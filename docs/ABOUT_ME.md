# About Winston Koh

> **tl;dr**: 10+ years in financial services → AI engineering pivot. Systems thinker who builds tools, not just uses them.

## The Career Arc

### Chapter 1: Financial Services (2012-2022)

- Started in operations, ended in strategy
- Learned how institutions *actually* work (vs. how they claim to work)
- Developed pattern recognition for organizational dysfunction
- Key insight: **Most problems are systems problems, not people problems**

### Chapter 2: The Pivot (2022-2024)

- Realized AI was the biggest leverage opportunity of my lifetime
- Spent 2 years going from "user" to "builder"
- 860+ sessions building Athena — my production-grade personal knowledge system
- Key insight: **Co-development with AI > Using AI**

### Chapter 3: Now (2024+)

- Building at the intersection of AI + systems thinking + financial engineering
- Focus: Tools that make knowledge work compounding, not ephemeral

| **AI Engineering** | Built RAG pipelines (Supabase pgvector + GraphRAG + RRF fusion) |
| **Technical Writing** | 860+ session logs, 42 case studies, zero fluff |
| **Automation** | 106 Python scripts for workflow optimization |
| **Strategic Thinking** | Spent 10 years navigating institutional politics and incentive structures |

## My Unfair Advantages

1. **10 Years of "Schlep Tolerance"**  
   I've done the unglamorous work: compliance spreadsheets, manual reconciliation, data cleanup. I don't romanticize problems; I solve them.

2. **Cross-Domain Pattern Recognition**  
   Financial services taught me to spot incentive misalignment, principal-agent problems, and coordination failures. These patterns appear *everywhere*.

3. **Builder Mindset**  
   I don't just use tools — I build them. Athena exists because I got tired of the limitations of off-the-shelf AI memory.

4. **Epistemic Rigor**  
   I document my reasoning. I version-control my decisions. I can show you *why* I made every major choice in this system.

## What I'm Looking For

I want to work on problems that:

- **Compound** — Where today's work makes tomorrow's work easier
- **Matter** — Where the output has real-world stakes
- **Require Systems Thinking** — Where the challenge is architectural, not just technical

I'm not looking for:

- "Move fast and break things" chaos
- Feature factories with no strategic coherence
- Teams that confuse activity with progress
