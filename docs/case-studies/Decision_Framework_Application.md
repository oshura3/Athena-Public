> **Domain**: Business Strategy  
> **Protocol**: Pattern Detection + Risk Assessment  
> **Date**: December 2025

## Context

A startup faced a critical decision: expand into a new market (high risk, high reward) or consolidate in their existing market (lower risk, stable returns).

## Analysis Framework Applied

### 1. SDR Calculator (Supply-Demand-Risk)

| Factor | New Market | Existing Market |
|--------|------------|-----------------|
| Supply (Competition) | Low | High |
| Demand (Need) | Unvalidated | Proven |
| Risk (Execution) | High | Low |
| **SDR Score** | 3.2 | 1.8 |

### 2. Law #1 Check (Ruin Prevention)

- **Question**: Does this path have >5% probability of irreversible ruin?
- **Analysis**: New market expansion requires 60% of runway
- **Verdict**: ⚠️ Ruin risk = 12% (exceeds threshold)

### 3. Decision

Applied **Satisficing Protocol**:

- "Good enough" solution: Pilot in new market with 15% of resources
- Preserve optionality while testing demand

## Outcome

The pilot validated demand at 40% lower CAC than projected. Full expansion proceeded in Q2.

## Pattern Extracted

> **Protocol 49**: When SDR > 2.5 but Ruin Risk > 5%, decompose the bet into smaller tranches.
