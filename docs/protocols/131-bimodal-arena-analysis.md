# Protocol 131: Blue Curve / Red Curve

> **Purpose**: Framework for hacking market entry when structurally disadvantaged. Domain-agnostic: applies to social, business, financial, educational arenas.

## Core Insight

Most people operate on the **Red Curve** — competing in arenas where their capital profile doesn't match. They grind, fail, and blame effort. The problem isn't effort; it's *distribution*.

> **Red Curve**: Wrong distribution for your capital = expected loss (no matter how hard you try).
> **Blue Curve**: Right distribution for your capital = modal success.

**The Overlap Point**: Your ceiling (+1 SD) may equal their floor (-1 SD). Fighting upstream = Boxer Fallacy.

## The Diagnostic

### Step 1: Map Your Distribution

| Position | Your Outcome | Probability |
|----------|--------------|-------------|
| -1 SD | Worst likely | ~16% |
| **Modal** | Most likely | ~38% |
| +1 SD | Best likely | ~16% |
| +2 SD | Lucky | ~2% |
| +3 SD | Miracle | ~0.1% |

### Step 2: Map Competitor Distribution

Same table for someone with correct capital for this arena.

### Step 3: Find The Overlap

- **Your +1 SD = Their -1 SD**: Wrong arena. Exit.
- **Your Modal = Their Modal**: Fair game. Compete.
- **Your -1 SD = Their +1 SD**: You dominate. Press.

## The 4 Paths (3 + 1 Edge Case)

| # | Path | Action | Cost Currency | Viability |
|---|------|--------|---------------|-----------|
| **1** | **Push** | Grind to shift from red → blue | Time/Effort | Only if capital is **acquirable** (skills, credentials). Fails if structural (age, genetics). |
| **2** | **Acquire** | Buy/leverage someone else's blue-curve capital | Money | Works if you have capital, not time. Requires proxy relationship. |
| **3** | **Exit** | Arena shift — play where your capital is correctly priced | Information | **Default recommendation.** Requires research, experimentation. |
| **4** | **Transactional** | Skip game, pay directly for outcome | Money | Edge case. Works in specific markets. Does not compound. |

## Cost Currency Matrix

| Path | Low $ | Low Time | Low Risk |
|------|-------|----------|----------|
| Push | ✅ | ❌ | ✅ |
| Acquire | ❌ | ✅ | ⚠️ |
| Exit | ✅ | ⚠️ | ⚠️ |
| Transactional | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ |

## Cross-Domain Examples

| Arena | Red Curve | Blue Curve | Exit Arena |
|-------|-----------|------------|------------|
| **Hiring** | Junior vs Senior Role | Experienced vs Senior Role | Junior vs Junior Role |
| **F&B** | Newbie × Restaurant | Operator × Restaurant | Newbie × Digital |
| **Investment** | Retail × Active Trading | Institutional | Retail × Index |
| **Medical Admission** | Generic RP 87 | H3 + Portfolio | Duke-NUS / Overseas |

## Decision Rule

```
IF your_ceiling <= competitor_floor:
    DO NOT try harder (Boxer Fallacy)
    CHOOSE: Push (if acquirable) OR Acquire OR Exit
ELSE:
    Compete normally
```

---

## Sprint Methodology

When using **Path 1 (Push)**, apply 90-day sprints:

> **One sprint = One goal.** Don't parallelize.

Sequence by dependencies:

1. Foundation first (e.g., academics before portfolio)
2. Lead time items (competitions with deadlines)

## 5. The Curve-Fit Test (Client Filter)

> **Goal**: Use Curve Theory to justify "Hard Reject" of bad clients.

**The Logic**:

- **The Client's Curve (Red)**: Budget < COGS, Scope > Capacity.
  - *Result*: If you accept, you enter a distribution where your **Modal Outcome = Loss**.
- **The Provider's Curve (Blue)**: Value-Based Pricing, Fixed Scope.
  - *Result*: Modal Outcome = Profit.

**The "Fit" Script**:
> *"We are structurally incompatible. You are asking for a Red Curve distribution (Hourly/Input-based), but my shop only runs on a Blue Curve distribution (Value/Outcome-based). I cannot service your curve without breaking my model."*

**Verdict**:

- If Client demands Red Curve mechanics -> **Hard Reject** (Protect the Distribution).
