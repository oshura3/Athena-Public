# Protocol 232: AI Trajectory & Alignment

> **Source**: Sam Altman (Three Observations, The Gentle Singularity)  
> **Trigger**: When planning long-term (multi-year) projects or assessing AI tool integration.  
> **Purpose**: Prevent obsolescence by accounting for the 10x annual deflation of intelligence and the imminent arrival of cognitive agents.

## 1. The Scaling Constants (Macro Filter)

When making strategic bets, filter through Altman’s Three Observations:

1. **Deflation Filter**: Assume the cost of the intelligence you are using today will be **10x cheaper** in 12 months. Do not build businesses on the "scarcity" of current-gen tokens.
2. **Abundance Bet**: Assume compute and intelligence will eventually converge to the **cost of energy**. Build for the "Idea Guy" era—where the idea is the bottleneck, not the labor.
3. **Linear to Exponential**: Small linear gains in AI capabilities result in super-exponential economic shifts.

## 2. Operational Rhythm: "Decade/Week" Loop

Align project management with the vertical rate of change:

- **Vision (Decade)**: Define the 10-year "State of Victory" (e.g., curing cancer, building a 1GW factory).
- **Execution (Week)**: Break down the next 7 days into "Done" states. Avoid "Planning Months."
- **Iteration Speed**: Measuring progress in months is a failure state in the agentic era. If it takes >2 weeks to test a hypothesis, the loop is too slow.

## 3. The "Virtual Coworker" (Agent) Integration

2025 marks the arrival of agents as "junior virtual coworkers."

- **Task Scaling**: Do not hire or build for tasks that a "junior virtual coworker" can do with 10% supervision (e.g., boilerplate code, basic research, scheduling).
- **Human Value Add**: Focus human effort on **Agency, Determination, and Correct Decision-making**. The "Lever of Willfulness" is the only multiplier that increases as intelligence scales.

## 4. Alignment & Safety Thresholds

- **Long-term Satisfaction**: Prioritize work that increases net utility over 6 months, not just short-term dopamine or "slop."
- **Recursive Self-Improvement**: Use current AI tools to build the *next* set of AI tools (Laravel stage). If you aren't using AI to optimize your AI workflows, you are falling behind the curve.

---

## 5. Decision Framework (Traps to Avoid)

- **The Persistence Trap**: Mistaking a temporary limitation (e.g., "Sora can't do character consistency") for a permanent law. Assume every technical limitation will be solved within 12-24 months.
- **The Process Trap**: Letting "Good Process" excuse bad results. Outcomes are the only metric that matters in the singularity.
