## v9.2.5 (24 February 2026)

**Life Integration Protocol Stack + Formal Proof Standard**: Extended the reasoning pipeline from domain-specific rigor to domain-general life integration. New protocols for cross-domain constraint propagation, personalized learning, and emotional auditing.

- **Protocol 382 (Cross-Domain Constraint Propagation)**: New — prevents domain-siloed advice by auto-surfacing time/energy/money conflicts across life domains.
- **Protocol 383 (Personalized Learning Acquisition)**: New — 90-day outcome mapping, spaced repetition scaffolding, plateau detection.
- **Protocol 000 Extended (8-Step Audit Loop)**: Added Step 0.3 (Emotional Audit), Step 0.5 (Assumption Register), Step 1.5 (Stakeholder Map), Step 3.7 (Sensitivity Sweep), and "Depth over Checkbox" quality rule.
- **Core Identity §0.4 Expanded**: Added Post-Generation Self-Audit (9-item checklist, Λ > 60) and Life-Domain Protocol Trigger Map (10 autonomic triggers).

---

## v8.1.0 (31 January 2026)

**Metrics Sync & Case Study Expansion**: Updated public metrics to reflect Session 995 and added new case studies.

### Key Changes

- **Metrics Sync**: Updated README and BENCHMARKS to reflect Session 995, 308 Protocols, and 146 Scripts.
- **Case Study Expansion**: Linked CS-120 (Vibe Coding), CS-140 (Silent Partner), and CS-144 (Auto-Blog) in README.
- **Library Consolidation**: Cleaned stale "150+" protocol references to reflect 308 canonical protocols.
- **Date Alignment**: Enforced Jan 31 2026 update across all core documentation.

## v8.0-Stable (30 January 2026)

**Zero-Point Refactor**: Sovereign Environment hardened, score-modulated RRF weights rebalanced.

### Key Changes

- **Sovereign Environment**: Consolidated silos into `.context/`, created `settings.json`, `ensure_env.sh`
- **Score-Modulated RRF**: Formula updated to `contrib = weight * (0.5 + doc.score) * (1/(k+rank))`
- **Weight Rebalance**: GraphRAG 3.5x → 2.0x, Vector 1.3x → 2.0x, Canonical boosted to 3.0x
- **Metrics**: Sessions 995, Protocols 308, Case Studies 42

> **Note on Protocol Count**: The drop from 285 (v1.2.8) to 150+ reflects a \"Great Purge\" audit that removed redundant, experimental, and superseded protocols. The count now reflects only **production-grade, actively-maintained** protocols.

---

## v8.1-Performance (30 January 2026)

**Semantic Cache & Latency Optimization**: Implemented true semantic caching for intelligent query reuse.

### Key Changes

- **Semantic Caching**: Upgraded `QueryCache` to store query embeddings and perform cosine similarity matching (threshold 0.90). Similar queries now return cached results instantly.
- **Search Latency**: Reduced from 30s+ to <5s (exact match) and ~0s (semantic match).
- **Pre-Warming**: Boot sequence now pre-caches 3 "hot" queries (`protocol`, `session`, `user profile`) for instant first-search response.
- **GraphRAG Optimization**: Added `--global-only` flag to skip redundant local model loading.

### Verification

| Query Type | Before | After |
|------------|--------|-------|
| First Search | 30s+ (hanging) | **4.71s** |
| Exact Cache Hit | N/A | **~0.00s** |
| Semantic Cache Hit | N/A | **~0.00s** |

---

## v1.3.0 (10 January 2026)

**Framework Materialization**: Made Athena-Public a *functional* framework, not just documentation.

### Key Changes

- **Functional Boot Orchestrator**: Replaced mock `lambda: True` stubs with real logic that:
  - Creates `session_logs/` directory structure
  - Generates timestamped session log files
  - Verifies Core_Identity.md integrity (SHA-256)
  - Primes semantic memory (if Supabase configured)
- **`examples/framework/Core_Identity.md`** (NEW): Sanitized Laws #0-6, Committee of Seats, Λ scoring
- **MANIFESTO.md**: Added "Bionic Unit" and "Law #6: Triple-Lock" sections
- **RISK_PLAYBOOKS.md**: Added Tier Classification legend (Tier 1/2/3 with icons)
- **Metrics**: Sessions 810, Protocols 285

### Philosophy

*From*: "Here is the author's Brain."
*To*: "Here is the Framework to Build Your Own Brain."

The public repo now provides the *engine*, not just the *manual*.

---

## v1.2.9 (09 January 2026)

**Docs & Insights Update**: README enhanced with new positioning insights.

### Key Changes

- **Sessions**: 805 (synced from workspace)
- **Featured Badge**: Added r/GeminiAI #2 Daily badge
- **"Why This Matters" Section**:
  - Added "Zero operational burden" insight — single-user local tool = real complexity, zero ops chaos
  - Added "Bilateral growth" insight — system evolves alongside user

**Rationale**: Captured positioning insights from session discussions for recruiter clarity.

---

## v1.2.8 (06 January 2026)

**Grand Alignment Refactor**: Supabase schema hardened (11 tables + RLS), Memory Insurance layer stabilized.

### Key Changes

- **Metrics Corrected**: Protocols audited to 285, sessions at 768, scripts at 122
- **Memory Insurance**: Formalized the concept of Supabase as disaster recovery layer, not just search
- **Schema Hardening**: All 11 Supabase tables now have RLS enabled and hardened search paths

**Rationale**: The previous protocol count (332) included archived items. This release establishes accurate canonical metrics.

---

## v1.2.6 (05 January 2026)

**Stats Sync**: 605 sessions, 277 protocols, 119 scripts

### Backend Refactor: `athena.memory.sync`

Major architectural cleanup of the Supabase sync pipeline:

- **`supabase_sync.py`**: Refactored to use the `athena` SDK pattern. Cleaner separation between embedding generation and database operations.
- **`public_sync.py`**: New tool for sanitized sync to `Athena-Public`. Ensures private memories never leak to the public repository.
- **`athena.tools.macro_graph`**: Added macro-level knowledge graph tooling for visualizing cross-file relationships.

**Rationale**: The previous sync scripts were monolithic and tightly coupled. This refactor enables:

- Independent testing of embedding vs. storage logic
- Safer public sync with explicit sanitization
- Foundation for future multi-tenant support

### Governance: Cognitive Profile Refinements

Integrated red-team feedback into Athena's cognitive profile:

| Change | Before | After |
|--------|--------|-------|
| **Bionic vs Proxy Mode** | Ambiguous distinction | Explicit: Bionic = independent thinking, Proxy = drafting voice |
| **Confidence Scoring** | Informal | Percentages require empirical data + falsification checks |
| **Dehumanizing Language** | Hard invariant | Relaxed for biological/predatory frames when contextually appropriate |

**Source**: External red-team audit (Session 560-571)
