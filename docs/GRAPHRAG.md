# GraphRAG: Knowledge Graph Layer

> **Status**: ⚠️ **NOT RECOMMENDED** (See Warning Below)  
> **Last Updated**: 1 February 2026  
> **Weight**: 2.0x in RRF fusion (balanced with Vector)

---

> [!CAUTION]
> **GraphRAG is EXPENSIVE.** Building this knowledge graph cost **~$50 in API fees** (using Gemini 3 Flash). Entity extraction requires calling an LLM for every single document chunk. For most use cases, **VectorRAG is FREE and sufficient**. See [VECTORRAG.md](VECTORRAG.md) for the recommended approach.

## Overview

Unlike flat vector search, GraphRAG extracts **entities** from your documents and clusters them into **communities** using the Leiden algorithm. This enables:

| Capability | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| **Cross-domain synthesis** | "How does X relate to Y?" queries |
| **Community detection** | Auto-discovers concept clusters |
| **Entity fan-out** | Expands queries to related concepts |

---

## Architecture

```
Documents → Entity Extraction → Knowledge Graph → Community Detection → Search
                                    ↓
                              ChromaDB Vectors
```

### Components

| Component | Format | Size | Purpose |
|-----------|--------|------|---------|
| `communities.json` | JSON | ~800KB | 1,460 auto-detected clusters |
| `entities.json` | JSON | ~2.3MB | Named entity index |
| `knowledge_graph.gpickle` | NetworkX | ~46MB | Graph structure |
| `chroma.sqlite3` | SQLite | ~78MB | Entity vector embeddings |

---

## Retrieval Weight

GraphRAG is weighted **2.0x** in the RRF fusion algorithm — at parity with Vector for balanced retrieval:

| Source | Weight | Rationale |
|--------|--------|-----------|
| **Canonical** | 3.0x | Curated single source of truth |
| **GraphRAG** | 2.0x | Structured knowledge clusters |
| **Vector** | 2.0x | Semantic similarity (parity with Graph) |
| Tags | 1.5x | Explicit keyword matches |
| Filename | 1.0x | Literal file matching |

---

## How It Works

### 1. Community Matching

When you query "sovereignty arbitrage":

```
Query → Tokenize → ["sovereignty", "arbitrage"]
                        ↓
    Search 1,460 communities for keyword matches
                        ↓
    Results: Community 1 (2 hits), Community 0 (1 hit)
```

### 2. ChromaDB Entity Search

Parallel to community matching, the system queries ChromaDB for semantically similar entities:

```
Query → Embed → Vector similarity search → Top 5 entities
```

### 3. RRF Fusion

Both GraphRAG results are fused with other sources using Reciprocal Rank Fusion:

```
Score = Σ (weight × 1/(k + rank))
```

Where `k = 60` (the RRF constant).

## Example Output

```
🔍 SMART SEARCH: "sovereignty arbitrage"
============================================================

🏆 TOP 3 RESULTS:

  1. [HIGH] [RRF:0.0574] Community 1 (1712 members, 2 hits)
     Signals: {"graphrag": {"rank": 1, "contrib": 0.05738}}
     📄 Matched: sovereignty, arbitrage | Cluster: #lmarena, #dismissive-avoidant...

  2. [HIGH] [RRF:0.0565] Community 0 (21 members, 1 hits)

  3. [HIGH] [RRF:0.0556] Community 504 (13 members, 1 hits)

## When GraphRAG Helps Most

| Query Type | GraphRAG Value | Example |
|------------|----------------|---------|
| Cross-domain | ⭐⭐⭐ High | "How do trading and psychology connect?" |
| Concept clusters | ⭐⭐⭐ High | "What relates to sovereignty?" |
| Specific lookup | ⭐ Low | "Where is Agentic Engineering Strategy?" (use filename search) |
| Semantic match | ⭐⭐ Medium | "Find protocols about risk" (vector also works) |

## Re-indexing

To rebuild the knowledge graph after adding new content:

```bash
python3 .agent/scripts/index_graphrag.py
```

This regenerates:

- Entity extraction from all Markdown files
- Community detection via Leiden algorithm
- ChromaDB vector embeddings

## Cost Warning

> [!WARNING]
> **Real-World Cost**: Building the Athena knowledge graph cost **~$30-50 USD** using Gemini 3 Flash API.
>
> **The Hidden Cost Driver**: Output Verbosity.
> The extraction process often prompts the LLM to rewrite nearly 75% of the input text as structured JSON.
>
> - **Input**: 4M tokens (~$2.50)
> - **Output**: 3M tokens (~$12.00+)
>
> **Recommendation**: Unless you specifically need entity relationship mapping ("How does X relate to Y?"), use **VectorRAG** instead. It's free and handles 90% of semantic search use cases.

## When GraphRAG Is Worth It

| Use Case | Worth It? | Why |
|----------|-----------|-----|
| Cross-domain synthesis | ✅ Yes | "How do trading psychology and schema therapy connect?" |
| Entity relationship mapping | ✅ Yes | Building a knowledge graph for research |
| Simple semantic search | ❌ No | VectorRAG is free and sufficient |
| Quick prototype | ❌ No | Too expensive for testing |
