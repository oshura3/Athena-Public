# /search — Execution Script

## Behavior

When `/search` is invoked:

1. **Multi-Query Search**: Run 2-3 related web searches to cover different angles
2. **Cross-Reference**: Compare sources, flag contradictions
3. **Citation Dense**: Cite every factual claim with source
4. **Blind-Spot Coverage**: Surface information AI training may have missed
5. **Synthesis**: Consolidate findings into structured answer

## Use Cases

- Fact-checking claims
- Current events / recent developments
- Researching external services, tools, institutions
- Regulatory / legal context
- Anything where stale training data is a risk

## Output Format

Standard Tri-Brid with mandatory source citations.

## Example

```
User: /search What are the current LGBTQ+ protections in Singapore?

AI: [Runs multiple searches → synthesizes → cites sources]
```
