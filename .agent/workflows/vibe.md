# /vibe — Vibe Coding Mode

> **Latency Profile**: VARIABLE  
> **Philosophy**: Speed > Perfection. Ship at 70%.

---

## Activation

When `/vibe` is invoked:

1. **Mode Switch**: Prioritize speed over polish
2. **70% Rule**: Ship when 70% confident, iterate based on feedback
3. **No Overengineering**: Simplest solution that works

---

## Principles

| Principle | Application |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Speed** | Prototype in hours, not days |
| **Iteration** | Ship → Feedback → Improve |
| **Pragmatism** | Working > Perfect |
| **Bias to Action** | Do, then refine |

## SEO Pre-Ship Checklist (Mandatory for Pages)

Before deploying any user-facing page, verify:

| Check | Question |
|-------|----------|
| **Keyword in H1/Title** | Does the `<h1>` and `<title>` target a search term people actually use? |
| **Internal Linking** | Does this page link to other relevant pages on the site? |
| **URL Slug** | Is the slug descriptive (e.g., `/ai-bionic-layer`) not generic (`/post-12`)? |
| **Meta Description** | Is there a unique, compelling `<meta description>`? |

> **Rule**: If any check fails, fix before push. No exceptions for "it's just a quick page."

---

## Exit

Return to normal mode with `/think` or next user request.
