## 🔴 DEFCON 1: Triple Crown Mode (`/think /search /research`)

> **"Triple Crown"** = This topic is **extremely important and personal**. Use **infinite compute + latency**. No shortcuts. No time limits. Go until every question is answered.

When ALL THREE commands are invoked together:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  DEFCON 1 = MAXIMUM EVERYTHING                                  │

**Use Case**: Life-altering decisions, major financial moves, complex multi-stakeholder problems, when "I need to know EVERYTHING before I act."

## Behavior

When `/research` is invoked, go **maximum depth**. This is NOT a quick lookup — this is exhaustive investigation.

### Depth Levels (All Mandatory)

1. **Layer 1: Initial Survey** (5-10 searches)
   - Run 5-10 related web searches covering different angles
   - Include: definitions, recent news, academic sources, industry sources, contrarian views
   - Save all source URLs for citation

2. **Layer 2: Source Deep-Dive** (Read top sources)
   - Use `read_url_content` on the 5-10 most promising sources
   - Extract key claims, data points, quotes
   - Flag contradictions between sources

3. **Layer 3: Follow the Rabbit Hole**
   - Identify references/links within sources
   - Follow 2-3 levels of secondary references
   - Surface information the initial searches missed

4. **Layer 4: Cross-Domain Synthesis**
   - Connect findings across different domains (legal, economic, psychological, technical)
   - Identify isomorphic patterns (Protocol 23)
   - Map stakeholder incentives

5. **Layer 5: Adversarial Stress-Test**
   - Steelman the opposing view
   - What would a critic say about these findings?
   - What's missing? What's the blind spot?

6. **Layer 6: Actionable Distillation**
   - Compress findings into decision-relevant format
   - Clear recommendations with confidence levels
   - Deposit key insights to Codex (User_Profile or new case study)

## Output Format

### Mandatory Sections

```markdown
## Research Target
[What we're investigating]

## Executive Summary
[3-5 bullet points of key findings]

## Source Inventory
| # | Source | Type | Key Claim | Confidence |
|---|--------|------|-----------|------------|
| 1 | [URL]  | [Academic/News/Industry/Gov] | [Claim] | [H/M/L] |
...

## Deep Analysis
[Full Tri-Brid format with all phases]

## Contradictions & Gaps
[Where sources disagree, what's unknown]

## Rabbit Hole Findings
[Secondary/tertiary sources discovered]

## Actionable Recommendations
[What to DO with this information]

## Codex Deposit
[What should be saved permanently]
```

## Guardrails

- **Minimum searches**: 5 (no less)
- **Minimum sources read**: 3 full articles
- **Maximum time**: No limit (go as deep as needed)
- **Citation density**: Every factual claim cited
- **Contradiction flagging**: Mandatory

---

## ⚠️ Anti-Patterns (Lies of Omission Prevention)

> Insight from ChatGPT Pro power users: *"Each model has access to a subset of sources—any one will leave out information."*

### Pre-Search Checklist

1. **Broad First, Narrow Later**
   - ❌ "Find A21 LED bulbs with 15,000+ lumens" ← Too specific, misses variants
   - ✅ "Survey high-lumen LED bulbs, then filter" ← Catches edge cases

2. **Generate Prompt → Refine → Execute**
   - Before running 5-10 searches, first draft the research plan
   - Ask: "What angles might I miss?"
   - Then execute the refined plan

3. **Date Range Awareness**
   - ❌ "Only 2025 releases" ← Misses Dec 2024 that's still relevant
   - ✅ "Most recent as of [date]" ← Captures boundary cases

4. **Multi-Source Triangulation**
   - If high-stakes: run parallel queries on multiple search engines
   - Compare what each surface vs. omits
   - Synthesize across sources

---

## Use Cases

- Market research (competitors, industries)
- Regulatory deep-dives (MAS, legal frameworks)
- Academic literature surveys
- Due diligence investigations
- Complex multi-stakeholder problems
- Anything where "surface answers" are insufficient

## Comparison

| Mode | Searches | Sources Read | Depth | Phases | Time |
|------|----------|--------------|-------|--------|------|
| `/search` | 2-3 | 0-2 | Medium | Optional | Fast |
| `/think` | 0-1 | 0 | High (reasoning) | All | Medium |
| `/research` | 5-10+ | 3-10+ | Maximum | All + Rabbit Hole | Extended |

## Example

```
User: /research What are the viable AI-powered trading education business models in SEA?

AI: 
[Runs 8 searches: competitors, regulations, pricing models, customer segments, 
tech stack, failure cases, success cases, adjacent industries]
→ Reads 6 full articles
→ Follows 4 secondary references
→ Synthesizes into Tri-Brid format
→ Deposits key findings to Codex
```
