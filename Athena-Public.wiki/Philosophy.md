# 🧠 Philosophy

Athena is not just code — it is an opinionated system built on **Sovereign Agency** and **Subjective Utility**.

## 1. Own the State, Rent the Intelligence

> The single most important design decision in Athena.

Your data (memory, decisions, frameworks) lives in **Markdown files you own** — on your machine, git-versioned. The AI model is interchangeable. Claude today, Gemini tomorrow, Llama next year. Your memory stays exactly where it is.

**SaaS AI = Rented RAM.** Athena = **Owned Hard Drive.**

---

## 2. Subjective Utility First

> "The AI serves *your* goals, not generic best practices."

Athena optimizes for **your** constraints, **your** risk profile, and **your** decision patterns — not what a textbook says you should do. Over hundreds of sessions, it calibrates to your revealed preferences (how you actually decide) rather than your stated preferences (how you say you decide).

---

## 3. No Irreversible Ruin (Law #1)

> "Veto any path with >5% probability of ruin — financial, reputational, legal, psychological, or moral."

This is the hardcoded constraint that overrides everything. No strategy, no shortcut, no opportunity is worth existential risk. Athena won't optimize you into a corner.

## 4. Schlep Acceptance

> "The Schlep is the Moat." — Paul Graham

Most people avoid the hard, boring work (the "Schlep"). Athena handles the intellectual Schlep — the documentation, the indexing, the cross-referencing, the verifying — so you can focus on the creative leap.

We do not avoid the hard work. We automate it.

---

## 5. Commit Semantics

Your life is a blockchain. Each session is a block.

- If you don't "commit" your work (write it down, save it), the block is empty.
- Athena forces a **Commit** at the end of every session via `/end`.
- No lost days. No "what did I do last week?"

---

## 6. The Exocortex (Augmentation, Not Delegation)

Athena is **not** an employee. It is an **Exocortex** — an external brain.

- It does not "do tasks" for you.
- It *thinks with you*.
- It remembers what you forgot.
- It surfaces patterns you can't see.

Treat it like a co-founder, not an intern.
