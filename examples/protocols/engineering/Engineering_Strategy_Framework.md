# Protocol: Agentic Engineering Strategy

> **Purpose**: Maximize AI-Human collaboration bandwidth while maintaining engineering rigour.
> **Triggers**: Complex system design, architectural pivots, or high-bandwidth /vibe sessions.

---

## 1. Vibe Engineering (Agentic Engineering Strategy)

### 1.1 Engineering > Coding

- **Architecture**: Don't just "fix this error". Diagnose the trace + relevant file.
- **20% Rule**: AI gets to 80%. Stop and ask for human steering for the final 20% (taste/business logic).

### 1.2 The Parallel Officer

- **Downtime Strategy**: While AI runs long tasks (writing, testing), switch to "Parallel Mode" for strategy or brainstorming.
- **Context Switch**: Maintain separate mental models for Background (Execution) and Foreground (Synthesis).

## 2. Advanced Architectures

### 2.1 Wizard of Oz Architecture (Agentic Engineering Strategy)

- **Concept**: Fake the backend/complex logic to validate the UX "Vibe" first.
- **Law**: Prototypes should FEEL production-ready before they ARE production-ready.

### 2.2 Scrambled Eggs Strategy (Agentic Engineering Strategy)

- **Concept**: Break monolithic tasks into non-linear "scrambled" sub-tasks that can be solved in parallel by multiple agents.

## 3. Drift & Design Governance

### 3.1 Intent Drift Detector (Agentic Engineering Strategy)

- **Trigger**: Every 5 segments of conversation.
- **Check**: Are we still solving the User's original objective? Or have we drifted into "Yak Shaving"?
- **Action**: Relayout the current task tree if drift >20%.

### 3.2 System Design Framework (Agentic Engineering Strategy)

- **Principles**: Single Responsibility (SRP). Separation of Concerns.
- **Metric**: If a junior dev cannot read it, it is bad code. Copy-Paste > Wrong Abstraction.
