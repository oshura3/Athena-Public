# Protocol 162: PMOD Framework

> **Tags**: `#pmod` `#business` `#distribution` `#framework`

## 1. The Framework

**PMOD** = Problem → Market → Operations → Distribution

```
┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                         PMOD Framework                       │
├──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│   P  Problem       →  Does it hurt enough to pay?           │
│   M  Market        →  Are there enough people with the pain?│
│   O  Operations    →  Can you deliver profitably?           │
│   ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────   │
│   D  Distribution  →  Can you REACH them at CAC < LTV?      │
└──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

## 1.5 The Nullification Rule (Fatality of Start)

> "IF the starting point is wrong, nothing else really matters. Optimising for operations and distribution is a waste of time."

**The Logic**: `Result = (P x M) x (O + D)`

* **P/M (The Start)**: These are **Multipliers**. If P or M is zero (wrong problem, wrong market), the total outcome is Zero.
* **O/D (The Execution)**: These are **Additives** (or scaling functions). They determine *how big* the win is, but they cannot create a win from a zero start.
* **Verdict**: Do not optimize Ops/Dist until P/M is non-zero.

## 2. The Core Insight

**P, M, O are table stakes. D is the game.**

| Component | Difficulty | Why |
|-----------|------------|-----|
| Problem | Easy | Pain points are observable |
| Market | Easy | Demand validation is cheap (search volume, competitors) |
| Operations | Easy | Execution is learnable |
| **Distribution** | **HARD** | Requires sweat equity — no shortcuts |

## 3. The D Tax (Distribution Costs)

| Path | Cost Type | Speed | Risk |
|------|-----------|-------|------|
| Paid Ads | Cash burn | Fast | CAC > LTV death spiral |
| Content/Organic | Time burn | Slow | Compounds if sustained |
| Referrals | Relationship burn | Variable | Hard to scale |
| Platform Dependency | Equity burn | Risky | Algo changes kill you |

**Critical Truth**: There is no "hack" for distribution. You pay one way or another.

## 4. Diagnostic Questions

1. **P**: "Does this problem hurt enough that people already pay to solve it?"
2. **M**: "How many people have this problem, and can I reach them?"
3. **O**: "Can I deliver this solution at a margin that makes sense?"
4. **D**: "What is my CAC, and is it sustainable vs. LTV?"

## 5. Case Studies

### SG Pools (Government Monopoly)

* **P**: "I want to get rich quick" — primal, irrational
* **M**: All of Singapore
* **O**: Near-zero marginal cost
* **D**: Solved via legal monopoly (legislated distribution)

### TheA1Physics (Content-First Tutor)

* **P**: "My kid is failing Physics" — universal parent pain
* **M**: ~40K O-Level students/year
* **O**: 1 tutor, WhatsApp, physical class
* **D**: TikTok (22K likes) + IG + Telegram funnel (content-first)

## 6. The Rule

> If you can't answer "How do I win D?" — you don't have a business. You have a hobby.
