# Protocol 192: Systematic Reconstruction (Law #65)

> **Status**: ACTIVE  
> **Source**: Zero-Point Codex (Dec 2025)  
> **Laws**: Law #65 (Structure > Schema > Tactics)  
> **Trigger**: Repeated behavioral failure despite "trying hard"

## Philosophy

> **"Willpower is a depletable resource. Structure is a constant."**

When tactics fail and schemas trigger, **Structure** is the only reliable defense. Don't try to "be better" in the moment. Build a system that makes the error impossible.

## The Three-Layer Stack

| Layer | Definition | Example Problem | Fix Efficiency |
|-------|------------|-----------------|----------------|
| **L1: Tactics** | What you say/do in the moment | "I shouldn't have sent that text." | Low (Fail under stress) |
| **L2: Schema** | Internal emotional wiring | "I feel abandoned." | Medium (Takes years to heal) |
| **L3: Structure** | The environment/rules | "I was in the shower at 8pm." | **High** (Instant) |

## Law #65: Structural Supremacy

**Axiom**: If you rely on L1 (Tail) to wag L2 (Dog), you will fail. You must use L3 (Cage) to contain the Dog.

### Case: The Impulse Spending Trap

* **L1 Fix**: "I'll browse the online store but just window shop, I won't buy anything." (Relies on willpower).
  * *Result*: Failure. Schema overpowers Tactic.
* **L3 Fix**: "I delete the shopping apps. I unsubscribe from promo emails." (Changes the Structure).
  * *Result*: Success. The temptation is physically removed.

### Case: The "Let me think" Client

* **L1 Fix**: "I'll try not to get angry when they stall."
  * *Result*: Passive-aggressive leak.
* **L3 Fix**: implement a **Pre-qualification Funnel**.
  * *Process*: Video -> Form -> "Ready to Decide" checkbox -> Call.
  * *Result*: You never talk to "Let me think" people. The trigger is deleted.

## The Reconstruction Protocol

When you catch yourself failing repeatedly:

1. **Stop optimizing L1 Tactics**. (Stop rewriting texts).
2. **Acknowledge L2 Schema**. (Admit "I am triggered").
3. **Design L3 Structure**.
    * *Question*: "What physical or systemic change would make this behavior impossible or unnecessary?"
    * *Actions*: Block numbers, change venues, install filters, hire gatekeepers, change business models.

**"Don't build a better brake pedal. Build a road without that cliff."**

## Integration

* Use with **[Protocol 112: Form-Substance Gap](<!-- Private: .agent/skills/protocols/ --> pattern-detection/112-form-substance-gap.md)** (Structure prevents access to Form).
* Use with **[Protocol 161: Sovereign Operating Protocol](<!-- Private: .agent/skills/protocols/ --> decision/161-sovereign-operating-protocol.md)**.
