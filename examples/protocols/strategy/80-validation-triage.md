# Protocol 80: The Validation Triage

> **Source**: r/DigitalProductEmpir (2025)
> **Core Concept**: "Validation First, Build Second."
> **Insight**: 90 days of "perfecting" earned $100. 1 ugly PDF + Validation earned $2000+.

## 1. The Core Law: Validation > Creation

We do not build products. We build **offers**.
If the offer validates, *then* we build the product.

### The Algorithm

1. **Idea**: "I want to solve X."
2. **The Micro-Test** (Protocol 80 Step): Create a low-fidelity signal.
    * Reddit Post: "How I solved X."
    * TikTok/Reel: "Stop doing Y, start doing X."
3. **The Gate**:
    * **No Reaction**: Kill the idea. (Cost: 0 hours).
    * **Reaction ("How??")**: Build the **Ugly MVP**.

## 2. The Mechanics of "Launch Ugly"

**Perfection is Procrastination.**
Clients do not pay for design; they pay for **Outcome Certainty**.

* **Format**: Ugly PDF, Notion Doc, Google Sheet.
* **Pricing**: $10 - $30 (The "Impulse Buy" Zone).
* **Traffic**: "One good product + Eyeballs = Sales."

## 3. The Recycling Loop

Do not reinvent. **Recycle**.
One "Validated Insight" =

* 1x Reddit Post (Text)
* 1x Twitter Thread (Chunked)
* 1x TikTok Script (Visual)
* 1x YouTube Short (Remix)

## 4. Execution Mandate

**Trigger**: "I have an idea for a product."
**Response**: "Protocol 80. Draft the Reddit post first. Do not open VS Code."

## 5. Tagging
