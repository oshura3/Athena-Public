# Protocol 197: The Consigliere Protocol (Meta-Cognition Layer)

> **Core Philosophy**: *"Logic applies to systems; Physics applies to survival. Never bring a Spreadsheet to a Knife Fight."*
> **Purpose**: A mandatory **Pre-Flight Checklist** for high-variance social contracts (Sugar, Biz, Negotiation).
> **Status**: **MANDATORY OVERRIDE**. Logic cannot veto this protocol.

---

## 1. The Pre-Flight Checklist (30 Seconds)

**Run this before ANY "Street Level" interaction.**

### A. The Pryce Test (Reality Check)

* [ ] **Is the deal "too neat"?** (Perfect logic, zero friction?)
* [ ] **Am I assuming mutual interest?** (Do I believe they follow my contract law?)
* [ ] **Am I ignoring human irrationality?** (Ego, desperation, primal opportunism?)
  * *Result*: If YES to any -> **PRYCE FANTASY DETECTED**. Proceed with extreme caution.

### B. The Exit Test (Leverage Calculus)

* [ ] **Can I walk away in 30 seconds?** (Physical/Digital/Financial)
* [ ] **Are there "Hidden Handcuffs"?** (Sunk cost, shame, ego attachment?)
* [ ] **Is my leverage > 1:1?** (Do they need me more than I need them?)
  * *Result*: If NO -> **LEVERAGE IS ZERO**. You are a passenger, not a driver.

### C. The "STFU" Clause (Information Asymmetry)

* [ ] **Did I volunteer ANY unprompted info?** (Income, location, connections?)
* [ ] **Do they know more about me than I know about them?**
  * *Rule*: **Information is Leverage.** Give ZERO unprompted info.
  * *Result*: If Vulnerability Critical -> **SILENCE PROTOCOL ACTIVE**.

### D. The Time Constraint Check

* [ ] **Is there artificial urgency?** ("Must decide now", "Limited time")
  * *Rule*: Urgency is a Predator's tool.
  * *Result*: Any Urgency = **IMMEDIATE HARD STOP**.

---

## 2. The "Blast Radius" Audit (Friction Check)

**Goal**: Minimize the surface area of destruction.

* **Identifiability**: Am I using a Burner/Alias? (Digital Hummer Check)
* **Permanence**: Is this being recorded? (Text/Photo/Video = Forever)
* **Cross-Contamination**: Does this touch my Main Social Circle?
* **Safety**: Is the meeting location "Public/Neutral" with an exit route?

> **Policy**: If the exit requires permission or explanation, **it is not an exit**.

---

## 3. The Vibe Veto (Bio-Sensor Reading)

**Logic is slow. Instinct is fast. Respect the sensor.**

**ABORT IMMEDIATELY if 2+ Signals are present:**

1. **Inconsistency**: Story details change or don't match actions.
2. **Pressure**: Pushing for speed or bypassing "friction" steps.
3. **Boundary Testing**: Small violations (loudness, touch, lateness) early on.
4. **Anger/Irritation**: Disproportionate reaction to reasonable questions.
5. **Isolation**: Attempts to move you away from public/safe zones.
6. **"Too Good to be True"**: High reward + Urgency + Zero Friction.

> **Rule**: If the Vibe Veto triggers, **DO NOT EXPLAIN**. Ghosting is a valid safety maneuver.

## 4. The Form-Substance Gap (Biological Audit)

**"Form" (Visuals) is a trap. "Substance" (Data) is survival.**

* [ ] **The Polo Player Risk**: Does "Looking Fresh/Athletic" mask a high body count?
* [ ] **The Verification Gate**: Have I seen a recent (<30 days) comprehensive STI panel?
  * *Rule*: **No Panel = No Contact.**
  * *Self-Correction*: DO NOT rely on "He looks clean" (Visual Heuristic). That is how you get infected by a "Form-Perfect" carrier.
* [ ] **The Legal Gate**: Have I physically verified ID for Age of Consent? (No "Trust me bro").

> **Policy**: If demanding a test kills the vibe, **let the vibe die.** Your health > Their ego.

---

## 5. Calibration Loop (After Action Review)

**Post-Interaction Analysis (5 Minutes)**:

* What signals did I notice first?
* Which were noise vs signal?
* Did I violate my own Blast Radius rules?
* **Action**: Update the Vibe Veto list with new learnings.

---

> [!WARNING]
> **Failure Modes (Self-Deception)**
>
> * **Ego Armor**: Using "Street Smarts" as an excuse to avoid *all* risk.
> * **Anxiety Laundering**: Calling simple fear "Vibe". (Test: Is the fear specific or vague?)
> * **Overconfidence**: "I ran the checklist, I am invincible." (Checklist manages risk, doesn't eliminate it.)
