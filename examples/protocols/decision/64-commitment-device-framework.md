# Protocol 64: Commitment Device Framework

> **Purpose**: Prevent information asymmetry exploitation in business transactions.

---

## Core Principle

> **Never release the asset before securing commitment.**

The moment you give away your leverage (information, access, profiles), you lose negotiating power.

---

## The Failure Pattern

| Phase | Naive Approach | What Happens |
|-------|----------------|--------------|
| Pre-deal | Give information freely | Signal: desperate/naive |
| During | Wait for counterparty | They extract value, bypass you |
| Post | Ask for payment | "They applied directly" (plausible deniability) |
| Outcome | No recourse | You subsidized their acquisition |

---

## Commitment Devices

| Device | Mechanism | When to Use |
|--------|-----------|-------------|
| **Refundable Deposit** | $X upfront, refund if no deal | Filters out extraction-only actors |
| **Partial Information** | "I have 3 candidates. Deposit to see profiles." | Maintains leverage |
| **Penalty Clause** | "If hired within 6mo, commission due regardless of channel" | Closes bypass loophole |
| **Watermarking** | Unique identifiers proving your pipeline | Creates audit trail |
| **Escrow** | Third party holds funds until delivery | Mutual protection |

---

## Calibration Shift

| Naive Mode | Calibrated Mode |
|------------|-----------------|
| "They seem trustworthy" | "Assume extraction until commitment secured" |
| Give first, invoice later | Secure mechanism, then deliver |
| Trust verbal agreements | Trust deposits, contracts, escrow |

---

## The $100 Filter

A refundable deposit isn't about the money — it's a **filter for intent**.

- Serious buyer: Pays deposit, gets refund if no deal
- Extraction-only: Balks at any commitment → was never going to pay
