# Protocol 243: The Delulu Gap (Prima Facie ≠ Actuality)

> **Status**: ACTIVE  
> **Created**: 28 December 2025  
> **Tags**: #psychology #risk-management #decision-making #trading

---

## 1. Core Principle

> **What sounds optimal in calm conditions often inverts under stress. Optimize for the stressed version of the actor, not the calm version.**

The "Delulu Gap" is the distance between:

| Mode | Definition | Dominant Emotion |
|------|------------|------------------|
| **Prima Facie** | "This sounds good in my head" | Optimism, Hope, Greed |
| **Actuality** | "This is what happens when reality punches" | Regret, Panic, Tilt |

---

## 2. The Pattern

```
Upside Fixation + Unexamined Worst-Case = Delulu Gap
```

### Symptoms

1. **Optimizing for best-case**: "If everything goes right..."
2. **Dismissing low-probability ruin**: "That won't happen to me"
3. **Underweighting future emotional state**: "I'll handle it rationally"

### The Trap

The actor makes decisions based on their *current calm self*, not the *future stressed self* who will actually face the consequences.

---

## 3. Case Examples

| Domain | Prima Facie (Delulu) | Actuality |
|--------|----------------------|-----------|
| **Trading (Investor)** | "Risk $10K to earn more!" | One bad week = $0, relationship destroyed |
| **Copy-Trading Prospect** | "I'll invest $20K next month!" | Flakes, trader tilts from wasted hope |
| **TADA Vomit Driver** | "Passengers are reasonable adults" | Passenger defects, driver eats $70 + tilt |
| **Self-Deception Trap** | "I'm just being authentic" | Reality lag = destroyed relationships + consequences |
| **Startup Founder** | "We'll raise Series A in 6 months" | Runway burns, no raise, fire sale |

**Common thread**: Assuming actor rationality in your favor. Reality doesn't care about your assumptions.

---

## 4. The Heuristic

> **"Design for the 2am stressed version of every participant — not the calm afternoon version."**

### Operationalization

1. **Identify all actors** (you, counterparty, regulator, market)
2. **For each actor, imagine their worst emotional state** (panic, greed, revenge, desperation)
3. **Ask: "Does the system still work when this actor is in that state?"**
4. **If no → Add structural friction** (cool-downs, limits, pre-commitments)

---

## 5. The Counter-Script (FinanceApp Application)

When an investor says: *"Why not just risk the whole $10K? You can earn more!"*

> **Response**: "Because when you're up, you think like this. When you're down 50%, you'll think very differently. These safeguards aren't for current-you — they're for 2am-you who wants to panic-reload. We're protecting us from that version."

**Frame**: You're not limiting upside. You're protecting them from their *future regretful self*.

---

## 6. Integration with Existing Laws

| Law | Integration |
|-----|-------------|
| **Law #1 (No Ruin)** | Delulu Gap is HOW people walk into ruin — by underweighting worst-case |
| **Law #3 (Actions > Words)** | Calm promises are words; stressed actions are truth |
| **Protocol 163** | Pre-commitment devices exist to protect against the stressed self |
| **Protocol 193** | Ergodicity check catches non-recoverable scenarios |

---

## 7. Meta-Application

This protocol applies to **yourself** — not just counterparties.

When you think: *"I'll definitely stick to my trading rules when I'm down 30%"*

Ask: *"Have I tested this? Or is this Prima Facie confidence?"*

If untested → **Pre-commit structurally** (kill-switches, account limits, cooling periods).
