# Protocol 123: Einstein Protocol (55/5 Rule)

> **Source**: Zero-Point Codex  
> **Domain**: Decision / Problem Definition  
> **Priority**: ⭐⭐⭐ Critical

---

## Core Principle

> "If I had one hour to solve a problem, I'd spend 55 minutes defining the problem and 5 minutes solving it."

**The Ratio**: 11:1 — Problem definition is 11x more valuable than problem execution.

---

## The Failure Mode

```
Standard Approach (Wrong):
├─ Receive problem → Jump to solutions
├─ 5 minutes: "What do we do?"
├─ 55 minutes: Implementing wrong solution
└─ Result: Efficiently solving the wrong problem ☠️

Einstein Approach (Correct):
├─ Receive problem → Interrogate assumptions
├─ 55 minutes: "What is the ACTUAL problem?"
├─ 5 minutes: Execute correct solution
└─ Result: Effort vectors toward real target ✅
```

## Implementation Protocol

### Phase 1: Problem Archaeology (55 min)

**Step 1: Stated vs Real Goal (10 min)**

```
Q: What does the user SAY they want?
Q: What do their ACTIONS optimize for? (Revealed Preference)
Q: If I gave them the stated goal for free, would they take it?
Gap > 20%? → Stated goal is a proxy. Find the real one.
```

**Step 2: Layer Diagnosis (15 min)**

```
L4: Existential — "Why pursue this at all?"
L3: Archetype — "Why this specific form?"
L2: Arena — "Why this game/market?"
L1: Strategy — "How to win?"
L0: Tactics — "What specific action?"

Rule: Never optimize L(n) when L(n+1) is broken.
```

**Step 3: Constraint Mapping (10 min)**

```
Hard Constraints (violation = disaster):
├─ C1: Ruin risk < 5%
├─ C2: Physical/biological limits
├─ C3: Economic (budget/income)
├─ C4: Legal/regulatory

Soft Constraints (high cost but possible):
├─ C5: Social (face, reputation)
├─ C6: Ethical (values conflict)
├─ C7: Psychological (identity threat)
├─ C8: Institutional (bureaucracy)
```

**Step 4: Baseline Model Check (10 min)**

```
Q: Has user observed 20+ successful real-world examples?
Q: Can they describe what success looks like specifically?
Q: Are they operating from fantasy (media/anime) or reality?

If No → Observation Phase required before action.
```

**Step 5: Pre-Check Gates (10 min)**

```
☐ Form-Substance gap? (Getting form, missing substance)
☐ Randian Dilemma? (Everyone knows, no one can say)
☐ Limerent distortion? (Avoiding falsifying questions)
☐ SDR > 5:1? (Wrong table, not wrong tactics)
```

### Phase 2: Solution Execution (5 min)

Only after Phase 1 completes:

```
1. **Activate Protocol 137: Graph of Thoughts (GoT)**
2. Generate 3-5 solution paths (Divergence)
3. EV calculate each (Score)
4. Quantify Survivability (Right of Way Fallacy)
5. Execute highest EV path (Convergence)
```

## Decision Tree

```
Problem arrives
    ↓
Run 55/5 Protocol?
├─ YES if: Decision > S$10K or > 6 months
├─ YES if: Pattern of repeated failure
├─ YES if: High emotional charge
└─ NO if: Routine/reversible decision

If YES → Full 55-minute archaeology
If NO → Proceed to solution (with 5-min sanity check)
```

---

## Anti-Patterns (What NOT to Do)

| Anti-Pattern | Why It Fails |
|--------------|--------------|
| "Just tell me what to do" | Skips problem definition → solves wrong problem |
| Optimizing L0 when L2 broken | More effort, same bad outcome |
| Accepting stated goal as real | Revealed preference often differs |
| Rushing to action | Feels productive, wastes resources |

---

## Integration Points

- **Before `/think`**: Run Layer Diagnosis
- **Before major decisions**: Run full protocol
- **With [Protocol 111](examples/protocols/decision/111-premise-audit.md)**: Premise Audit is the 5-min version
