# Protocol 261: The Skeptic Gate (Probabilistic Branching)

> **Category**: Decision Making / Cognitive Defense
> **Tags**: #logic #probability #red_team #anti_fantasy
> **Related**: [Protocol 49: Pareto Frontier], [CS-372: Vice Marketplace]

## 1. Core Concept

**Single-Track Thinking is the root of Delusion.**
When you observe a data point and assign it only **one** meaning (The "Happy Path"), you act on a fantasy.
The **Skeptic Gate** forces you to generate at least **3 Hypotheses** with assigned probabilities before taking action.

> **Law**: "Never bet the house on a single interpretation."

## 2. The Branching Logic

When Action `A` occurs (e.g., "He didn't reply"), spawn 3 timelines:

### Path A: The Good (Optimistic)

* **Hypothesis**: He is busy/overwhelmed but still interested.
* **Probability**: 20%
* **Action**: Wait silently.

### Path B: The Bad (Pessimistic)

* **Hypothesis**: He lost interest (Soft Rejection).
* **Probability**: 60%
* **Action**: Mirror fade / Move on.

### Path C: The Ugly (Cynical/Realist)

* **Hypothesis**: He is keeping me as a "Backup Option" (Orbiter).
* **Probability**: 20%
* **Action**: Initiate "Direct Response" test to force a hard Yes/No.

## 3. The "If... Then..." Matrix

| Condition | Hypothesis | Operational Response |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **If** Price is Low... | **Then** Quality is likely cut (Central Kitchen). | **Verify** Hygiene/Safety standards. |
| **If** Price is High... | **Then** Alibi is likely strong (Luxury). | **Verify** Status Signaling value. |
| **If** Reply is fast... | **Then** Interest is high OR Desperation is high. | **Test** for abundance vs neediness. |
| **If** Reply is "Busy"... | **Then** Priority is low (Soft Rejection). | **Exit** or Deprioritize. |

## 4. Application: The "Central Kitchen" Case

* **Observation**: "1 Operator feeds 13 schools."
* **Hypothesis 1 (Official)**: Efficiency scale creates better quality control. (10%)
* **Hypothesis 2 (Realist)**: They will cut corners to defend margins. (80%)
* **Hypothesis 3 (Black Swan)**: A single pathogen will nuke the entire system. (10%)
* **Decision**: Do not rely on valid Hypothesis 1. Hedge against H2 and H3 (Bring own food).

## 5. Summary

The Skeptic Gate prevents **Confirmation Bias** (Nickerson, 1998). By forcing yourself to write down the "Bad" and "Ugly" hypotheses, you prevent your brain from auto-selecting the "Good" one just because it feels safe.
