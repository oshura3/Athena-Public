# Protocol 243: Prima Facie vs Actuality Gap (Reality Check Framework)

## Summary

A diagnostic framework for detecting the gap between **what you think should happen** (Prima Facie / Inside View) and **what actually happens** (Actuality / Outside View). Rooted in Kahneman's Planning Fallacy research.

> **Core Insight**: If you cannot state the **outside view base rate** for your activity, you are operating on pure inside view — and likely delusional.

---

## The Framework

### Step 1: State Your Prima Facie Model

Write out the linear funnel you *believe* exists:

```text
A → B → C → D → SUCCESS
```

Example (Tuition Agency):

```text
Client Calls → Collect Info → Send Tutor List → Client Picks → Close + Collect Fee
```

### Step 2: Find the Outside View Base Rate

Research what *actually happens* in similar cases:

| Metric | Your Assumption | Industry Reality |
|--------|-----------------|------------------|
| Conversion Rate | ? | ? (find real data) |
| Retention | ? | ? |
| Circumvention/Leakage | ? | ? |
| CAC vs LTV | ? | ? |

**Sources**: Industry reports, forum admissions, WhatsApp groups, honest operators.

### Step 3: Calculate the Delta

```text
Delta = |Prima Facie Expectation - Actual Base Rate|
```

**Interpretation**:

- **Delta < 20%**: Model is calibrated. Proceed.
- **Delta 20-50%**: Optimization needed. Adjust expectations.
- **Delta > 50%**: **Planning Fallacy Alert.** Re-evaluate the arena, not your effort.

### Step 4: Map the Failure Modes

Identify where value leaks:

| Failure Mode | Description | % of Leads Lost |
|--------------|-------------|-----------------|
| Dilly-Dally | Indecision, endless questions | ? |
| Ghost | Zero-exit-cost abandonment | ? |
| Circumvent | Both parties cut you out | ? |
| Soft Reject | "I'll think about it" (polite exit) | ? |
| Convert | Actual success | ? |

### Step 5: Run the SDR Calculator

If **SDR > 5:1**, the arena is structurally unwinnable. Exit or pivot.

## Canonical Example: The Tuition Agency Trap

### Prima Facie Model (Inside View)

```text
Call → Info → List → Pick → Close (50%+ assumed)
```

### Actuality (Outside View — Singapore 2024-2025)

| Metric | Prima Facie | Actuality | Source |
|--------|-------------|-----------|--------|
| Close Rate | 50%+ | **4-9%** | Agency owner forums, CNA |
| Circumvention (Month 3+) | Low | **68-74%** | Private WhatsApp admissions |
| Average LTV | Recurring | **6.8 weeks** | Industry average |
| CAC (Meta, SG) | $100-150 | **$180-$450** | 2024-2025 competition data |

### Unit Economics (Brutal Truth)

```text
Ad Spend per Lead:     $250 (mid-range)
Close Rate:            7%
Revenue per Close:     $120 (2 weeks)
Gross per Lead:        $120 × 7% = $8.40
Net per Lead:          -$241.60
```

**Verdict**: -$300+ per lead net. The hemorrhage, not the bleed.

### The Structural Flaw

> Your value exists only in the 5 seconds between "sending the list" and "parent Googling tutor's name."

Once A meets B, C (you) becomes a tax. Both parties have **aligned incentives** to cut you out.

## The Diagnostic Checklist

Before entering ANY marketplace/connector business:

- [ ] Can I state the outside view base rate for conversion?
- [ ] What is the circumvention/disintermediation risk?
- [ ] Do I own the value, or just the introduction?
- [ ] Is CAC < LTV after churn?
- [ ] Is my SDR < 5:1?
- [ ] Am I selling people (replaceable) or a result (defensible)?

If you answer NO to 3+ of these → **Do not enter.**

## The Pivot Framework

| Model | You Own | Moat | Verdict |
|-------|---------|------|---------|
| **Connector** | Nothing | Zero | ❌ Structural trap |
| **Platform** | Network effects | Medium | ⚠️ Only if you reach critical mass |
| **Provider** | IP/Curriculum/Method | High | ✅ Defensible |
| **Aggregator** | Demand + Supply control | Very High | ✅ Winner-take-all |

**The Leap**: Stop selling People → Start selling a Result.
