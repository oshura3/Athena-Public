# Protocol 163: Pre-Commitment Heuristic

> **Purpose**: Prevent asymmetric downside exposure by requiring counterparty investment *before* you invest.

---

## Core Principle

> **"Whoever invests first has the weaker position."**

If the other party's words cost them nothing but their defection costs you something — **require collateral or walk**.

---

## The Failure Pattern (Chaser Mode)

```text
You invest (time, work, trust) → They make verbal promise → You follow up → They flake → You absorb tilt + loss
```

| Phase | What Happens | Why It Fails |
|-------|--------------|--------------|
| Pre-exposure | They express interest ("I'll invest $20K") | Words = 0 cost |
| You invest | Time, follow-up, expectation | Your skin in the game |
| Outcome | They flake, change mind, defect | No recourse. You eat the loss. |

---

## The Fix (Qualifier Mode)

```text
They express interest → You say "Call me when ready" → Ball in their court → You move on
```

| Dimension | Chaser Mode ❌ | Qualifier Mode ✅ |
|-----------|------------------|---------------------|
| Who invests first | You | Them |
| Who chases | You | Nobody |
| Tilt exposure | High | Zero |
| Frame | Needy seller | Abundant provider |
| Selection effect | Attract tire-kickers | Filter to serious actors |

---

## The Heuristic

**If the other party's words cost them nothing, but their defection costs you something — require collateral or walk.**

### Collateral Types

| Type | Mechanism | Example |
|------|-----------|---------|
| **Financial** | Deposit, retainer, upfront payment | 50% deposit before work |
| **Effort** | They must do work first | "Fill out this form, then we talk" |
| **Public** | Social commitment, reputation stake | "Post about this, then I'll share" |
| **Time** | They must wait / invest time | "Get back to me when $ is ready" |

---

## Domain Applications

| Domain | The Asymmetry | Pre-Commitment Fix |
|--------|---------------|-------------------|
| **Freelancing** | Client can refuse to pay after work | 50% upfront, 50% on delivery |
| **Sales** | Prospect can waste your time | "Call me when funds are ready" |
| **Dating** | They can ghost after you invest | Qualify before heavy investment |
| **Rental** | Tenant can trash property | Security deposit |
| **B2B Services** | Scope creep, non-payment | Retainer + SOW before work |
| **Ride-hailing** | Passenger can vomit and refuse to pay | $200 refundable hold upfront |

---

## Law #3 Connection

> **Words = 5-30% signal. Actions = 70-95% signal.**

"I'll invest $20K next month" = words. Zero cost to say.  
"Here's $20K in this account" = action. Full commitment.

**Take words at face value.** Don't add weight they didn't put there.

---

## Calibration Note

The "qualifier" stance can sound dismissive if miscalibrated:

| Audience | Phrasing |
|----------|----------|
| **Direct/crypto bros** | "I'm not in a rush to do business with you" |
| **HNW/referral-based** | "No rush at all. Reach out when timing's right." |

Same frame, different packaging.

## Relationship to Protocol 64

[Protocol 64: Commitment Device Framework](<!-- Private: .agent/skills/protocols/ --> decision/64-commitment-device-framework.md) covers **mechanisms** (deposits, escrow, watermarking).

**Protocol 163** covers the **higher-order heuristic**: the *mindset shift* from "chaser" to "qualifier" and the principle of shifting investment burden.
