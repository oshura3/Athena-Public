# Protocol 188: STPP (Side-by-Side Timeline Projection)

> **Status**: ACTIVE  
> **Source**: Zero-Point Codex (Dec 2025)  
> **Laws**: Law #54 (STPP), Law #64 (Fantasy-Pain Proportionality)  
> **Trigger**: Limerence, High-Stakes Emotional Decisions, "This time is different"

---

## Philosophy

> **"The brain generates a Fantasy Timeline to extract dopamine. Physics generates a Reality Timeline to extract payment. You must look at both simultaneously."**

Limerence and poor strategy thrive on **singular visualization** (seeing only the best case). STPP forces **dual visualization**.

## Law #54: The Protocol

### Step A: Extract Fantasy Frame (The Pitch)

* **Source**: Dopamine / Schema.
* **Characteristics**: Linear, frictionless, perfect ending.
* **Prompt**: "If everything goes perfectly, what happens?"

### Step B: Construct Reality Frame (The Physics)

* **Source**: Base rates, social dynamics, friction.
* **Characteristics**: Costly, entropic, regression to the mean.
* **Prompt**: "Based on the last 100 people in this situation, what actually happens?"

### Step C: The $50,000 Bet (Forcing Function)

* **Question**: "If you had to bet SGD 50,000 of your own money on which timeline will occur, where do you put the chips?"
* **Betting Fantasy** = Gambler (Feeling-based)
* **Betting Reality** = Strategist (Math-based)

## Law #64: Fantasy-Pain Proportionality

> **"Pain is not proportional to the event. Pain is proportional to the GAP between Fantasy and Reality."**

$$ \text{Pain} = \text{Fantasy Magnitude} - \text{Reality Magnitude} $$

* **Scenario A**: Expect T3 acquaintance behavior, get T3. **Gap = 0. Pain = 0.**
* **Scenario B**: Expect Soulmate (T1), get T3. **Gap = 100. Pain = 100.**

**Mitigation**: You cannot control Reality (others' actions). You CAN control Fantasy (your expectations). Collapse the fantasy to collapse the pain.

## The Dual-Track Visualization Table

| Timeframe | Fantasy Frame (Dopamine) | Reality Frame (Physics) |
|-----------|--------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Month 1-3** | Honeymoon, "Finally understood", Special | Extraction, Utility-usage, Investment asymmetry |
| **Month 6** | Inner Circle, Deep bond, "Invited to everything" | Boredom, Ghosting, "Too clingy", Blocked |
| **Endgame** | **Salvation** (<1%): Soul-gap filled | **Ruin** (>80%): Reputation loss, financial loss, trauma |
| **EV** | +∞ | Negative |

## Integration

* Use with **[Protocol 140: Base Rate Audit](examples/protocols/decision/140-base-rate-audit.md)** for Reality Frame population.
* Use with **[Protocol 114: Limerent Reality Distortion](<!-- Private: .agent/skills/protocols/ --> psychology/114-limerent-reality-distortion.md)**.
