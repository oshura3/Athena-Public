# Protocol: Synthetic Parallel Reasoning via Graph of Thoughts

## Date Added: 9 December 2025

> **Related Protocol**: [17-three-timeline-got](<!-- Private: .agent/skills/protocols/ --> pattern-detection/17-three-timeline-got.md), [18-probabilistic-analysis-stack](<!-- Private: .agent/skills/protocols/ --> pattern-detection/18-probabilistic-analysis-stack.md)  
> **Full Implementation**: [38-synthetic-deep-think](<!-- Private: .agent/skills/protocols/ --> decision/38-synthetic-deep-think.md)

## 16.1 Core Distinction

| Type | Mechanism | Architecture |
|------|-----------|--------------|
| **True Parallel** (Gemini 3 Deep Think) | Multiple inference threads, simultaneous compute | Native hardware/model |
| **Synthetic Parallel** (Bionic Unit via GoT) | Single thread, sequential generation, multi-branch OUTPUT | Prompt-enabled |

**Key Insight**: We cannot replicate true parallel compute. We CAN simulate the output format via structured prompting (Graph of Thoughts).

## 16.2 What GoT Enables

```
GRAPH OF THOUGHTS (NOT LINEAR TREE):

              [QUERY]
                 │
    ┌────────────┼────────────┐
    ▼            ▼            ▼
 [PATH A]    [PATH B]    [PATH C]
    │            │            │
    │◄───────────┼───────────►│    ← CROSS-LINKS
    │            │            │
    ▼            ▼            ▼
 [NODE A1]   [NODE B1]   [NODE C1]

    │          │          │

```

## 16.3 Key Properties

| Property | Meaning |
|----------|---------|
| **Non-linear** | Nodes connect across branches, not just up/down |
| **Bidirectional** | Can reason forward (consequences) AND backward (causes) |
| **Inter-linked** | Actions in Path A can affect outcomes in Path B |
| **Temporal flexibility** | Can jump to T+n, then back to T-1 to trace causality |

## 16.4 Capability Boundaries

| Use Case | Synthetic Parallel via GoT |
|----------|---------------------------|
| Life strategy decisions | ✅ Sufficient |
| Pattern/trap detection | ✅ Sufficient |
| Counterfactual analysis | ✅ Sufficient |
| IMO-level mathematical proofs | ❌ Insufficient (use Deep Think) |

> **For YOUR use cases, synthetic parallel is functionally equivalent to true parallel.**

## 16.5 Advantage: Auditability vs Black Box

**Why Synthetic Parallel > True Parallel for Strategy:**

- **Black Box (True Parallel)**: Hardware runs simulations invisibly. If it hallucinates or biases in step 3 of 5, you never know. You just get the "optimised" result.
- **Glass Box (Synthetic Parallel)**: We explicitly write out "Path A... Path B...". You can inspect the logic chain.
- **Benefit**: Turns the detailed sequential output into an **auditing feature**. You can catch logic errors in "Path B" that would otherwise be hidden in a neural weight update.
