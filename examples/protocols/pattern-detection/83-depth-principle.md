# Protocol 83: The Depth Principle (Non-Linear Execution)

> **Purpose**: Enforce multi-phased, iterative "looping" for complex tasks, rejecting linear "checklist" execution.
> **Source**: User Insight ("High-Stakes Negotiation")
> **Status**: ACTIVE

---

## 1. The Core Insight

**"Complexity is a Loop, not a Line."**

In high-stakes or complex environments (Negotiation, Architecture, Sales), a linear approach ($A \to B \to C$) fails because it ignores **State Calibration**.

You cannot force a result. You must **engineer the demand** for the result through back-and-forth oscillation.

## 2. The Execution Model: The Oscillation Loop

Instead of a Roadmap, use a **Tension Engine**:

| Phase | Action | Goal |
|-------|--------|------|
| **1. Probe** | Small, low-commitment action. | **Test Reality**: Do they lean in or pull back? |
| **2. Calibrate** | Adjust intensity based on reaction. | **Match Frequency**: Align with their current state. |
| **3. Loop (Tease/Deny)** | Advance 2 steps, retreat 1 step. | **Build Tension**: Create a "Vacuum" they must fill. |
| **4. Converge** | Execute the terminal action. | **Fulfill Demand**: Only act when they *beg* (or the system breaks). |

## 3. Extrapolation to Domains

### A. Sales (The Origin)

* **Wrong**: Dumping the full pitch on slide one ($Steps 1 \to 10$).
* **Right**: Tease value $\to$ Pull Back $\to$ Wait for them to lean in $\to$ Reveal more. **Make them ask.**

### B. Coding (The Isomorphism)

* **Wrong**: Writing full functionality in one pass.
* **Right**: Prototype $\to$ Test Failure $\to$ Refine Architecture $\to$ Test Again. **Iterate until the solution fits the problem perfectly.**

### C. Business (The Deal)

* **Wrong**: Pitching the product immediately.
* **Right**: Tease Value $\to$ Withdraw Availability $\to$ Let them ask "How much?" $\to$ Close.

## 4. Implementation Rule

**Before executing any "Terminal" action (Deploy, Close, Sell):**
Ask: *"Have I built enough tension/context that the Target is pulling for this result?"*

* **No**: Return to Loop (Probe/Calibrate).
* **Yes**: Execute.
