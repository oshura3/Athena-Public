# Protocol 95: The Cynical Baseline (The Toxic Premise)

> **Core Axiom**: "Assume the environment is hostile/extractive by default. Any benevolence is a glitch, not the feature."
> **Related Laws**: Law #0 (Subjective Utility), Law #1 (No Ruin), Protocol 92 (De Facto Reality)

## 1. The Problem: The "Noble Gap"

Most high-conscientiousness individuals operate on the **Noble Premise**:

- *belief*: "If I work hard, the system will reward me."
- *belief*: "Authority figures are rational and benevolent."
- *belief*: "Suffering is a sign I need to grow."

**The Crash**: When a toxic system acts toxically (e.g., assigning useless work), the Noble Premise creates **Cognitive Dissonance**. The individual tries to bridge the gap by blaming themselves ("I'm not resilient enough"), leading to self-gaslighting.

## 2. The Solution: The Cynical Baseline

Shift the "Zero Point" of expectations from **Neutral/Positive** to **Negative/Hostile**.

### The Algorithm

1. **Assess Environment**: Is this an Institution, Bureaucracy, or Corp? -> **Yes.**
2. **Set Baseline**: "This system is designed to extract maximum value from me for minimum cost."
3. **Interpret Event**:
    - *Event*: Last-minute work on Friday.
    - *Old interpretation*: "I must have failed to plan / They need me."
    - *New interpretation*: "The machine is extracting labor. This is expected functionality."
4. **Reaction**:
    - **Emotion**: Zero surprise. Zero shame. Zero guilt.
    - **Action**: Minimum Viable Compliance (MVC). Protect resources.

## 3. Benefits

1. **Immunity to Gaslighting**: When a boss says "This is for your growth," you recognize it immediately as a manipulation script, not a truth.
2. **Resource Conservation**: You stop spending emotional energy trying to "fix" or "understand" the insanity. You just navigate it.
3. **Strategic Clarity**: You stop trying to win the "Noble Game" (which doesn't exist) and start playing the "Survival Game" (which is real).

## 4. Nuance: Cynicism vs. Nihilism

- **Nihilism**: "Nothing matters, I give up." (Passive/Depressive)
- **Cynical Baseline**: "The system is rigged, so I will play strategically to minimize my loss and maximize my private gain." (Active/Strategic)

## 5. Case Reference

- **Daryl Cheng (SAF)**: Failed to apply Cynical Baseline. Internalized systemic toxicity as a "challenge" to "become the best I can be." Result: High suffering, high emotional labor.
