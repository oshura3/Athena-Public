# Insight: The Rigged Game Principle — Table Selection Over Table Performance

## Date Added: 10 December 2025

> **Related Protocol**: [30-arena-taxonomy](<!-- Private: .agent/skills/protocols/ --> pattern-detection/30-arena-taxonomy.md)

## 34.1 Core Insight

> **You cannot win a game where the scoring system penalises your fundamental architecture. The GTO isn't "adapt" — it's EXIT.**

When evaluation criteria are structurally misaligned with your wiring, no amount of effort changes the expected value. The game is rigged at the rules level.

## 34.2 The Pattern

```
RIGGED GAME STRUCTURE:

YOUR NATURAL STACK:
├─ Introversion (needs solitude, deep work, written communication)
├─ High Conscientiousness (delivers quality, reliable)
├─ Analytical depth (thinks before speaking)
│
EVALUATION CRITERIA (Implicit):
├─ Social performance ("mingles", "joins events")
├─ Verbal assertiveness ("speaks up in meetings")
├─ Extroverted signalling ("passionate", "visible")
│
MISMATCH:
├─ You are graded on criteria that penalise your wiring
├─ Playing harder doesn't change the scoring system
├─ Adapting is unsustainable and depletes energy
└─ EV: Negative regardless of effort
```

## 34.3 Why "Adapt" Fails

| Strategy | Problem |
|----------|---------|
| "I'll be more social" | Draining, unsustainable, never authentic |
| "I'll speak up more" | Quality of thought decreases; forced output |
| "I'll mask my introversion" | Energy leak; eventually detected anyway |
| "I'll prove my work speaks for itself" | Doesn't register on their scorecard |

**The scoring system doesn't change because you try harder.** It only changes when the scorer changes.

## 34.4 The GTO: Table Selection

```
WRONG QUESTION:
"How do I win at this table?"

RIGHT QUESTION:
"Should I be at this table at all?"

GTO DECISION TREE:

1. Identify evaluation criteria (explicit and implicit)
2. Compare to your natural stack
3. If structural mismatch detected:
   ├─ Can you change the scorer? (Rare. Usually no.)
   ├─ Can you change the criteria? (Rare. Usually no.)
   └─ EXIT. Find table that rewards your actual architecture.
```

## 34.5 Why People Stay in Rigged Games

| Trap | Mechanism |
|------|-----------|
| **Sunk cost** | "I've already invested X years" |
| **Stability bias** | "At least I know this devil" |
| **Schema activation** | "If I leave, it proves I'm not good enough" |
| **Proving worth** | "I should be able to make this work" |
| **No alternative frame** | Never considered table selection as an option |

## 34.6 The Fish-Tree Analogy

> **An introvert being judged on social performance is like a fish being judged on tree-climbing.**
>
> The GTO isn't "learn to climb."
> The GTO is "find water."

## 34.7 Application Note

When you detect evaluation criteria mismatch:

1. **Name the mismatch** — Don't gaslight yourself into thinking you're the problem
2. **Calculate EV honestly** — Can you ever win on these criteria?
3. **Check exit options** — What tables exist that reward your stack?
4. **Execute EXIT** — Table selection > table performance
5. **Don't look back** — Rigged games don't become fair with time

> **Stop trying to survive in the wrong arena. Exit. Find arenas that reward your stack.**
