# RED-TEAM REVIEW — v4.3 (Strategic Matrix)

> **Purpose**: Adversarial audit and strategic expansion of any high-stakes artifact.
> **Philosophy**: "It is not enough to find the flaws; we must architect the pivot."

---

## CONSTANTS & DEFINITIONS (Read First)

* **Law #1 (No Ruin)**: Any strategy with >5% risk of existential downside (bankruptcy, jail, reputation death) is auto-vetoed.
* **Respects Physics**: Feasible within strict constraints of Time, Capital, Compute, and Energy. No "magic info" steps.
* **Sycophancy**: Validating the user's existing bias to be "helpful" instead of accurate.
* **Orphan Statistic**: A number presented without a source, denominator, or causal link.
* **Survivorship Bias**: Assuming success is replicable by ignoring the invisible graveyard of failures.

---

## PHASE 0: PRIORS & PREMISES (Mandatory)

Before reviewing, assume the "Alien Observer" stance and declare:

1. **Thesis**: What is the core argument/frame of this artifact?
2. **Falsification**: What specific metric/event would prove this wrong? (e.g., "Churn >4%")
3. **Excluded Reality**: What valid perspective is strictly IGNORED here?
4. **Reality Check**: What is the *unspoken* cultural narrative or meta-game here? (e.g., "Implied consent," "Face-saving," "Hidden debt").

> *Do not proceed until these 4 are answered.*

---

## PHASE 1: THE OBJECTIVE RUBRIC

Score the artifact against this matrix. **Start at 50%**. Deduct for vagueness.

| Component | Weight | Criteria for Max Score | Score |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Logic & Rigor** | **30%** | Deductively sound. Checks **Survivorship Bias** & **Sample Size (n>1)**. No orphan stats. | __ / 30 |
| **Bias Mitigation** | **20%** | Steelmans opposition. Checks for Sycophancy. | __ / 20 |
| **Completeness** | **20%** | Addresses "The Victim". Covers **Edge Cases** (Cultural nuance/misinterpretation). | __ / 20 |
| **Strategic Align** | **15%** | Aligns with Law #1. Respects Physics. High Utility. | __ / 15 |
| **Actionability** | **15%** | Recommendations are distinct, executable, and ranked. | __ / 15 |

**TOTAL SCORE**: ______ / 100
**CONFIDENCE**: [ Low / Med / High ]

> **⚠️ CONFIDENCE CAP**:
> If Confidence is **LOW**, the Maximum Total Score is capped at **60/100**.
> *Reasoning: You cannot have a "Great Strategy" (90/100) that you are guessing about.*

## PHASE 2: ADVERSARIAL LENSES (The Attack)

Critique through these specific personas. **One concrete objection per lens.**

| Lens | The Attack Question |
| :--- | :--- |
| **The Skeptic** | "I disagree because this relies on **Survivorship Bias** or **Small Sample Size (n=1)**. Show me the graveyard." |
| **The Victim** | "This strategy harms me because [Negative Externalities]." |
| **The Historian** | "This assumes current returns continue forever. What about **Mean Reversion**? Does this work in a bear market?" |
| **The Anthropologist** | "You are missing the **Cultural Narrative**. What is the *implied* social contract here? (e.g., The 'Tinder Dinner' implication)." |
| **The Cynic** | "You are lying to yourself about [Hidden Incentive/Ego]." |
| **The System** | "This ignores the 2nd order effect on [Broader Ecosystem]." |
| **The Entropy** | "This will rot via [Vector] because [Reason]." |

*Entropy Vectors*: Incentive Rot, Complexity Rot, Competition Rot, Reg Rot, Tech Obsolescence.

---

## PHASE 3: STRATEGIC EXPANSION (SWOT + TOWS)

*Instruction: Use Phase 2 objections to populate Weaknesses/Threats.*

### 3.1 TOWS Matrix (The Pivot)

* **SO (Maxi-Maxi)**: How to use Strength to capture Opportunity? (Attack)
* **WO (Mini-Maxi)**: How to fix Weakness to capture Opportunity? (Improve)
* **ST (Maxi-Mini)**: How to use Strength to block Threat? (Defend)
* **WT (Mini-Mini)**: How to survival/exit? (Mitigate)

---

## PHASE 4: DECISION ENGINE (MCDA)

Rank top 3 recommendations.

**Formula**:
`Final Score = ((Impact + Ease) / Risk Factor) * Entropy Multiplier`

* **Risk Factors**: Low = 1.0 | Med = 1.5 | High = 2.0
* **Entropy Multipliers**: Stable = 1.0 | Decaying = 0.8 | Rotting = 0.5

| Recommendation | Impact (1-10) | Ease (1-10) | Risk (L/M/H) | Entropy (1.0/0.8/0.5) | Final Score |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Option A | 8 | 5 | Low (1.0) | Stable (1.0) | **13.0** |
| Option B | 9 | 4 | Med (1.5) | Decay (0.8) | **6.9** |
| Option C | 7 | 8 | High (2.0) | Rot (0.5) | **3.7** |

---

## PHASE 5: THE BLIND SPOT & KILL SWITCH

1. "I am least confident about ______ because ______." (Check for **Survivorship Bias** here).
2. **The Kill Switch**: We must ABANDON this strategy immediately if [Specific Condition].

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

1. **Final Score**: XX/100 (Confidence: X)
2. **The Kill Shot**: (The single most dangerous flaw found).
3. **The #1 Recommendation**: (The highest scoring Phase 4 option).
