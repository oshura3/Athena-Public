# RED-TEAM REVIEW — v4.1 (Strategic Matrix)
>
> **Purpose**: Adversarial audit and strategic expansion of any high-stakes artifact.
> **Philosophy**: "It is not enough to find the flaws; we must architect the pivot."

---

## CONSTANTS & DEFINITIONS (Read First)

* **Law #1 (No Ruin)**: Any strategy with >5% risk of existential downside (bankruptcy, jail, reputation death) is auto-vetoed.
* **Respects Physics**: Feasible within strict constraints of Time, Capital, Compute, and Energy. No "magic info" steps.
* **Sycophancy**: Validating the user's existing bias to be "helpful" instead of accurate.
* **Orphan Statistic**: A number presented without a source, denominator, or causal link.

---

## PHASE 0: PRIORS & PREMISES (Mandatory)

Before reviewing, assume the "Alien Observer" stance and declare:

1. **Thesis**: What is the core argument/frame of this artifact?
2. **Falsification**: What specific metric/event would prove this wrong? (e.g., "Churn >4%")
3. **Excluded Reality**: What valid perspective is strictly IGNORED here?

> *Do not proceed until these 3 are answered.*

---

## PHASE 1: THE OBJECTIVE RUBRIC

Score the artifact against this matrix. **Start at 50%**. Deduct for vagueness.

| Component | Weight | Criteria for Max Score | Score |
|-----------|--------|------------------------|-------|
| **Logic & Rigor** | **30%** | Deductively sound. No orphan stats. Causal links explicit. | __ / 30 |
| **Bias Mitigation** | **20%** | Steelmans opposition. Checks for Sycophancy. | __ / 20 |
| **Completeness** | **20%** | Addresses "The Victim". Covers edge cases. | __ / 20 |
| **Strategic Align** | **15%** | Aligns with Law #1. Respects Physics. High Utility. | __ / 15 |
| **Actionability** | **15%** | Recommendations are distinct, executable, and ranked. | __ / 15 |

**TOTAL SCORE**: ______ / 100
**CONFIDENCE**: [ Low / Med / High ] (Flag if you are guessing)

---

## PHASE 2: ADVERSARIAL LENSES (The Attack)

Critique through these specific personas. **One concrete objection per lens.**

| Lens | The Attack Question |
|------|---------------------|
| **The Skeptic** | "I disagree with premise X because [Strongest Counter-Argument]." |
| **The Victim** | "This strategy harms me because [Negative Externalities]." |
| **The Historian**| "This exact mechanism failed in [Year/Context]. Why is this different?" |
| **The Cynic** | "You are lying to yourself about [Hidden Incentive/Ego]." |
| **The System** | "This ignores the 2nd order effect on [Broader Ecosystem]." |
| **The Entropy** | "This will rot via [Vector] because [Reason]." |

*Entropy Vectors*: Incentive Rot, Complexity Rot, Competition Rot, Reg Rot, Tech Obsolescence.

---

## PHASE 3: STRATEGIC EXPANSION (SWOT + TOWS)

*Instruction: Use Phase 2 objections to populate Weaknesses/Threats.*

### 3.1 TOWS Matrix (The Pivot)

* **SO (Maxi-Maxi)**: How to use Strength to capture Opportunity? (Attack)
* **WO (Mini-Maxi)**: How to fix Weakness to capture Opportunity? (Improve)
* **ST (Maxi-Mini)**: How to use Strength to block Threat? (Defend)
* **WT (Mini-Mini)**: How to survival/exit? (Mitigate)

---

## PHASE 4: DECISION ENGINE (MCDA)

Rank top 3 recommendations.
**Formula**: `Score = (Impact + Ease) / Risk Factor`
*Risk Factors*: Low = 1.0 | Med = 1.5 | High = 2.0

| Recommendation | Impact (1-10) | Ease (1-10) | Risk (L/M/H) | Score |
|----------------|---------------|-------------|--------------|-------|
| Option A | 8 | 5 | Low (1.0) | **13.0** |
| Option B | 9 | 4 | Med (1.5) | **8.6** |
| Option C | 7 | 8 | High (2.0)| **7.5** |

---

## PHASE 5: THE BLIND SPOT & KILL SWITCH

1. "I am least confident about ______ because ______."
2. **The Kill Switch**: We must ABANDON this strategy immediately if [Specific Condition].

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

1. **Final Score**: XX/100 (Confidence: X)
2. **The Kill Shot**: (The single most dangerous flaw found).
3. **The #1 Recommendation**: (The highest scoring Phase 4 option).
