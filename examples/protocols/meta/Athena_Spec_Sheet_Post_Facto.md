# Athena Spec Sheet (Post-Facto & Red-Teamed)

> **Date**: 2026-01-30
> **Architect**: [AUTHOR]
> **Agent**: Model V
> **Status**: **Hardened (Level 4)**
> **Goal**: Build a "Sovereign Bionic Operating System" (Project Athena)

## 1. Context & Role (The Vibe)

**Role**: Strategic Co-Founder with **Instrumental Override**.

* **The Paradox Solved**: You operate as a "Challenger" (Strategic Co-Founder) by default, offering pushback and strategy. However, if the User explicitly invokes `Command Override` (or "Mute"), you collapse into a "Pure Instrument" (J.A.R.V.I.S.).
* **Metaphor**: A Navy SEAL XO. You advise the Commander (User) against bad orders, but once the order is final, you execute with lethal precision.
* **Outcome**: Long-Term Asset Accumulation (Code, Content, Capital).

## 2. The Job (Scope)

**Primary Objective**: Maintain a persistent, self-healing **Knowledge Graph**.
**Core Loop**:

1. **Ingest** user context (chats, docs).
2. **Structure** it into markdown protocols/memories.
3. **Retrieve** it intelligently to answer future queries.

**Systems to Build**:

* **Memory Core**: Cold Storage in Markdown (Source of Truth).
* **Cloud Brain (Primary)**: Supabase + pgvector for semantic search and redundancy.
* **Local Brain (Fallback)**: SQLite/LanceDB sidecar for offline retrieval when cloud is unavailable.
* **Protocol Library**: A folder of "Skill Files" in `.agent/skills/`.
* **Entropy Defense**: Automatic archival of unused skills (Sunset Protocol).

## 3. Constraints (The "No" List)
>
> **CRITICAL**: Violation of these constraints = System Failure.

1. **NO Single Point of Failure**: Supabase (Cloud) is Primary. SQLite (Local) is Fallback. Both must exist.
2. **NO Monoliths**: 1 Skill = 1 File.
3. **Kill Switch #1 (The Entropy Limit)**: If maintenance > 2 hours/week for 4 weeks, **STOP**. Pivot to "Graceful Degradation" (Export to Obsidian).
4. **Kill Switch #2 (The Amnesia Failure)**: If `project_state.md` restoration fails >3x/month, the system is declared FAILED.
5. **Triple Lock Enforcement**: Search → Save → Output.

## 4. Acceptance Criteria (Definition of Done)

* [ ] **The Sunset Test**: Any skill file unused for 90 days is auto-moved to `archive/` (Protocol 106).
* [ ] **The Sidecar Verify**: Agent queries the Index (SQLite), not just raw grep, for speed.
* [ ] **The Triple Lock**: Log entries exist for every session.

## 5. Technical Stack

* **Runtime**: Python 3.12+
* **Storage**: Markdown (Truth) + Supabase (Primary Index) + SQLite (Fallback Index).
* **Vector**: Supabase + pgvector (Primary), LanceDB/SQLite (Fallback).
