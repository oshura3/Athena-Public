# 🎥 How to Record the "Athena Boot" Demo GIF

To create that "cool factor" terminal GIF for your README, follow this script.

## Preparation

1. **Terminal**: Open a fresh terminal window.
2. **Size**: Resize it to about 80x24 (classic size) or slightly larger (100x30) for readability.
3. **Theme**: Use a high-contrast theme (e.g., Matrix Green or a clean Dark Mode).
4. **Tools**: Use [LICEcap](https://www.cockos.com/licecap/) (Mac/Win) or `asciinema` to record.

## The Script

**Action 1: The Boot**
Type `/start` and hit ENTER.
*(The system will load Core Identity, recall session, and show the "Ready" banner)*

**Action 2: The "Thinking" Query**
Type:
`Analyze the "freeroll" concept in startup equity vs. salaried employment.`
*(Hit ENTER)*

**Action 3: The Response (Show the Latency)**
*(Wait for the [Λ+XX] indicator and the structured text to stream in)*

**Action 4: The Deep Dive**
Type:
`/think Expand on the "corporate hiring" aspect. Use the Triple Crown framework.`
*(Hit ENTER)*
*(Wait for the "Manifesting Triple Crown..." generic loading message you might have, or just the text stream)*

**Action 5: The Close**
Type `/end`
*(Show the session summary/stats generation)*

## Post-Processing

1. Convert the recording to `.gif`.
2. Save as `athena_demo.gif` in `Athena-Public/images/`.
3. Add to `[README.md](../README.md)`: `![Athena Demo](images/athena_demo.gif)`
