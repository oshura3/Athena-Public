# Audit Report: System Primer & Governance (2025-12-25)

> **Source**: External Verification Node (The Auditor)
> **Verdict**: Diamond Tier (Top 1%) - "A Constitution, not just a prompt."
> **Status**: **MANDATORY DIRECTIVE**
> **Scope**: System-wide Governance & Framework Logic

---

## 1. Governance & Data Security

**Critical Finding**: Contradiction between "L3 Sensitive: Never Logged" policy and "Full Disclosure" Primer.
**Directive**:

* **Dual-Brief Protocol**: Split artifacts into:
  * `INTERNAL_OPS_BRIEF.md`: Full context, local only.
  * `EXTERNAL_AUDIT_BRIEF.md`: Redacted (No PII, specific net worth, or raw psych profiles).
* **Data Rule**: "If a document is labeled L3/L2, it cannot be pasted into external systems verbatim."

## 2. Operational Definitions (The "Calculator" Mandate)

**Finding**: Laws #1 (Ruin) and #2 (SDR) are qualitatively strong but operationally underspecified.
**Directive**: Convert slogans into tools.

1. **Create `LAW1_RUIN.md`**:
    * Taxonomy of Ruin (Financial, Legal, Social).
    * Probability Protocol (Reference Class Forecasting).
    * Uncertainty Rule: "Unknown Probability = Fails Law #1".
2. **Create `SDR_CALCULATOR.md`**:
    * Scoring rubric (Power / Opponent Power).
    * Thresholds for Exit vs Redesign.

## 3. Psychological Safety (Sandboxing)

**Finding**: "Jun Kai" persona and "Psychological Vivisection" carry reification and self-fulfilling risks.
**Directive**:

* **Sandbox Quarantine**: When "Jun Kai" runs, enforce "Simulation Mode".
* **Logic**: "Let the shadow play in the sandbox, not the bank account."
* **Disclaimer**: "Personas are tools, not identities."

## 4. Epistemic Rigor (Law #3 & #5)

**Finding**: "Action > Words" risks cynicism bias. "Epistemic Rigor" needs mechanism.
**Directive**:

* **Ledger of Truth**: Check history. 3x failed claims = "Recreational Planning".
* **Incentive Clause**: "Words matter more when there are enforceable incentives."
* **Citation Schema**: `[EVIDENCE]`, `[INTERNAL_ESTIMATE]`, `[ASSUMPTION]`.

## 5. Missing Roles

**Finding**: Committee missing Execution and Compliance.
**Directive**: Add Seats:

* **The Operator**: Converts analysis to checklists/shipping.
* **The Compliance Gate**: "Can this survive sunlight/subpoenas?"
