## 1. Asset Construction (The Exit)
>
> **Origin**: Session 48 (The PME Squeeze)

**Context**: The "Retrenchment Outlook 2026" validates the structural decline of the Singapore PME "Regional Hub" value proposition.
**Principle**: The only escape from the "Mid-Level Option Squeeze" is **Asset Construction**.
**Rule**: Every major task must contribute to a permanent asset (Code, Content, or Capital).
**Constraint**: "Don't just solve the ticket; build the tool that solves the ticket."

## 2. Methodological Arbitrage (The Theft)
>
> **Origin**: Session 48 (Claude Code Analysis)

**Context**: Competitor agents (Claude) are evolving superior autonomous workflows (`feature-dev`).
**Principle**: Steal mercilessly. We are model-agnostic.
**Rule**: If a competitor has a better workflow, **clone it immediately** (e.g., `feature-dev`, `hooks`).
**Goal**: Integrate "Silicon Valley Engineering Rigor" into "Singapore PME Resourcefulness".

## 3. Asymmetric Optionality
>
> **Origin**: Session 48 (FinanceApp Context)

**Context**: Employment is a decaying trade (short gamma). Assets are long gamma.
**Principle**: Prioritize actions that increase convexity.
**Heuristic**: "Cushy Job = Short Volatility Trade" (Small steady gains, massive hidden blow-up risk).
**Action**: Shift focus from "Maintenance" to "Builds".

## 5. Market Physics (The Arena)
>
> **Origin**: Session 20 (HWZ Case Studies)

**Rule 1: The Protocol-Task Mismatch (Carousell Paradox)**

* **Physics**: High-Trust Tasks (Renovation) cannot be executed on Low-Trust Protocols (Carousell).
* **Result**: Structural collapse (Scams).
* **Directive**: Never buy "Futures" (Service Contracts) on a "Spot" (Cash & Carry) marketplace.

**Rule 2: The Quality-Margin Death Spiral (Teochew Pau)**

* **Physics**: In food/service, Flavor = Asset. Cutting ingredients to save margin = Liquidating the Asset.
* **Result**: Value proposition evaporates -> Revenue drops -> Closure.
* **Directive**: Raise prices or close. Never degrade the asset.
