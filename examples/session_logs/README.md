# Session Logs

This directory contains example session logs demonstrating how to document AI-assisted development sessions.

## Purpose

Session logs serve as:

1. **Memory persistence** — Context that survives across sessions
2. **Audit trail** — Record of decisions and their rationale
3. **Learning data** — Patterns for improving future sessions

## Structure

Each session log should include:

- **Objectives** — What you set out to accomplish
- **Checkpoints** — Major milestones during the session
- **Key Decisions** — Important choices and why
- **Issues Encountered** — Problems and solutions
- **Next Session TODO** — Handoff for future work
- **Session Stats** — Quantified output

## Naming Convention

```
YYYY-MM-DD-session-NN.md
