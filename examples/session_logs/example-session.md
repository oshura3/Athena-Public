> This is an example of a well-structured session log showing best practices.

## Session: 2026-02-01-session-example

**Started**: 2026-02-01 09:00 SGT
**Ended**: 2026-02-01 11:30 SGT
**Duration**: 2.5 hours

---

## Objectives

1. [x] Implement user authentication endpoints
2. [x] Add rate limiting middleware
3. [ ] Write unit tests (deferred to next session)

---

## Checkpoints

### CP1 (09:15) — Context Loaded

- Read `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`
- Identified target files: `src/auth/`, `src/middleware/`
- Dependencies: `bcrypt`, `jsonwebtoken`

### CP2 (09:45) — Auth Endpoints Complete

- Created `POST /auth/register`
- Created `POST /auth/login`
- Created `GET /auth/me`
- Verified with curl tests

### CP3 (10:30) — Rate Limiter Added

- Installed `express-rate-limit`
- Applied to auth routes: 5 attempts/15 min
- Tested with rapid requests

### CP4 (11:15) — Documentation Updated

- Updated API docs in `docs/API.md`
- Added examples for each endpoint

## Key Decisions

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| JWT over sessions | Stateless, scales horizontally |
| bcrypt over argon2 | Simpler, sufficient for current scale |
| 5 req/15min limit | Balance security vs UX |

---

## Issues Encountered

1. **Password hashing slow** — Reduced salt rounds from 12 to 10
2. **Token expiry confusion** — Standardized to 24h for access tokens

---

## Next Session TODO

- [ ] Write unit tests for auth endpoints
- [ ] Add refresh token flow
- [ ] Integrate with frontend login page
