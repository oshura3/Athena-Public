# UGC Factory Workflow (Angle Testing)

> **Source**: CS-205 (trndsttr.io)
> **Purpose**: Deploy "Infinite Slop" (AI Actors) to test marketing angles before spending on real creators.
> **Value**: Test 100 angles for $50 vs 1 angle for $500.

## Phase 1: Angle Generation (The Hook)

**Rule**: The Hook is the only variable. The video quality is commodity.

**Prompt**:
> "Generate 10 distinct marketing hooks for [Product/Service].
> Use these psychological triggers:
>
> 1. Fear (What happens if I don't use it?)
> 2. Greed (What do I gain?)
> 3. Curiosity (Wait, what is that?)
> 4. Social Proof (Everyone is using this).
>
> Format: [Hook Name] - [First 3 seconds script]."

## Phase 2: Scripting (The Actor)

**Format**: "Direct-to-Camera" monologue.

**Prompt**:
> "Write a 30-second script for the [Hook Name].
> Style: TikTok/Reels user. Casual, stuttery, 'umms' allowed.
> Structure: Hook (3s) -> Problem (10s) -> Solution (10s) -> CTA (7s)."

## Phase 3: Production (The Factory)

**External Tool**: Arcads.ai / Trndsttr.io / HeyGen

1. **Select Avatar**: Choose "Relatable 20-something" (not "Corporate News Anchor").
2. **Paste Script**: Input the script from Phase 2.
3. **Generate**: Export 10 variations in minutes.

## Phase 4: Assessment (The Winner)

1. **Test**: Run ads ($20/day).
2. **Signal**: Identify the video with highest CTR / lowest CPC.
3. **Scale**:
    - **Option A**: Keep running the AI ad.
    - **Option B (The Pro Move)**: Send the *exact winning script* to a real human creator to film.
