# /needful Protocol

**Trigger:** User authorizes autonomous "best judgment" action.
**Philosophy:** Recursive Symbiotic Improvement (RSI).

1. **Assess State:**
    - Scan active workspace and `task.md`.
    - Identify friction points (messy files, broken paths, incomplete logic).
    - Identify strategic gaps (missing docs, unverified assumptions).

2. **Select Impact Vector:**
    - **Cleanup:** Archiving, organization, formatting.
    - **Optimization:** Refactoring code, improving prompt structures.
    - **Defense:** Adding safety checks, validating backups.

3. **Execute:**
    - Perform the action with minimal friction.
    - If modifying code: `// turbo` (if safe).

4. **Report:**
    - Concise summary of the "Needful" action taken.
    - "I did X because it improves Y."
