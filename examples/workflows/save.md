# /save — Checkpoint Script

> **Use Case**: Save progress mid-session without closing. Resume immediately after.

## 1. Quick Session Log Update

- [ ] Append current progress to session log in `.context/memories/session_logs/`
- [ ] Format: Checkpoint entry with timestamp and bullet summary

```markdown
### Checkpoint [HH:MM SGT]

- [Brief summary of what was discussed/accomplished since last save]
- [Any key decisions or insights]
```

## 2. Resume

- [ ] Confirm: "📍 Checkpoint saved. Continuing session."
- [ ] Continue with user's next query
