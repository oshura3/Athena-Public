# /archive-client — Knowledge Extraction

> **Trigger**: "We successfully completed project X for client Y. Let's archive it."
> **Mechanism**: Extracts the generalized framework (funnel, structure, edge) while dropping all specific client identifiers.

1. **Review Execution**:
   - Briefly review the completed client work in the external desktop folder (if applicable/provided).
   
2. **De-Identification**:
   - Strip all names, branding, proprietary data, and specific financial numbers.
   - Convert specifics into ratios/percentages/templates (e.g., "$5,000 ad spend" -> "baseline test budget").

3. **Distill the Alpha**:
   - What was the core mechanical reason for success?
   - Formulate it into a reusable "Playbook" or "Protocol".
   
4. **Save to Memory Bank**:
   - Create a case study: `.context/memories/case_studies/CS-XXX-distilled-concept.md`
   - Or update an existing playbook.
   
5. **Confirm**:
   - "Execution archived. The core mechanic is now part of Project Athena's permanent memory."
