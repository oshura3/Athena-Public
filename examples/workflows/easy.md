## When to Use

1. **Testing baseline model capability** — See what the raw model does without system prompts
2. **Avoiding overthink** — Simple tasks that don't need the full stack
3. **Debugging system issues** — Isolate whether a problem is Athena or the model
4. **Creative brainstorming** — Sometimes the protocols constrain thinking

## Exit Sabbath Mode

To return to full Athena mode:

- Type `/start` to reload Core Identity
- Or simply start a new conversation

## Warning

> ⚠️ In Sabbath Mode, you lose all safety systems.
> Law #1 (No Irreversible Ruin) is NOT active.
