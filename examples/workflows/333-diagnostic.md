# 333 Diagnostic Method (OfferFixer)

> **Purpose**: Automate the creation of high-value "Diagnostic Reports" to convert cold leads into clients.
> **Source**: CS-202 (Paul James)
> **Value**: Converts 5 mins of AI time into a $300 product (or high-trust sales asset).

## Phase 1: The Input

**Data Required**:

1. **Client URL**: (e.g., `www.tuition-center-sg.com`)
2. **Competitor URL**: (Optional, for contrast)

## Phase 2: The Analysis (5 Dimensions)

Run this internally or use `/research`:

1. **Positioning**: Is it clear *who* this is for? (Niche vs Generalist)
2. **Messaging**: Is the "Promise" visible above the fold?
3. **Visibility**: Does it appear in Google Maps/SEO?
4. **Credibility**: Are there reviews/testimonials visible?
5. **Offer**: Is there a "Mafia Offer" (irresistible) or just a "Contact Us"?

## Phase 3: The Report Generation

**Prompt for Agent**:
> "Act as a Marketing Auditor. Analyze [URL] against [Competitor URL].
> Generate a 'Growth Diagnostic Report' in Markdown.
>
> Structure:
>
> 1. **Executive Summary**: Grade them A-F.
> 2. **The 3 Critical Gaps**: (Pick the worst 3 from above).
> 3. **The 3 Fixes**: Specific actions to take.
> 4. **The Prize**: Projected revenue impact if fixed.
>
> Tone: Professional, direct, high-status consultant."

## Phase 4: The Delivery (The 333)

**The Rule**:

1. Identify **3** businesses.
2. Send **3** diagnostics (free or paid).
3. Expect **3** conversations.
