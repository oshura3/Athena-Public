# Pattern Example: Baseline Anchoring

> **Domain**: Psychology, Business, Negotiation
> **Purpose**: Demonstrate cross-domain pattern recognition

---

## The Pattern

**Problem**: People often operate from unrealistic expectations — fantasy-based thinking that doesn't match market reality.

**Solution**: Install a **baseline anchor** — show them what "normal" actually looks like, and let them self-calibrate.

## Cross-Domain Application

| Domain | Unrealistic Expectation | Baseline Anchor | Reality Check |
|--------|------------------------|-----------------|---------------|
| **Hiring** | "I want a senior engineer for junior salary" | "Market rate for 5+ YoE is $X-Y. Here's Glassdoor data." | Adjust budget or lower requirements |
| **Pricing** | "Your competitor charges less" | "Their scope is different. Here's comparison." | Apples-to-apples understanding |
| **Negotiations** | "I deserve a 50% raise" | "Average raise is 3-5%. Top performers get 10-15%." | Calibrated ask |
| **Expectations** | "This project should take 2 weeks" | "Similar projects took 6-8 weeks. Here's breakdown." | Realistic timeline |

│  1. DETECT → Identify unrealistic expectation                  │
│  2. SHOW   → Present market/reality baseline with evidence     │
│  3. GAP    → Make visible the distance between fantasy/reality │
│  4. OPTION → Offer paths: adjust expectation OR accept costs   │
│                                                                │
│  Result: Self-correction (they calibrate)                      │

## Why This Works

- **No lecturing**: You're not telling them they're wrong — you're showing reality
- **Evidence-based**: Baselines are verifiable (market data, historical examples)
- **Respects autonomy**: They decide what to do with the information
- **Universally applicable**: Same structure works in sales, analysis, management, negotiation

## Related Concepts

- **Anchoring bias** (Tversky & Kahneman, 1974) — first number sets the reference point
- **Expectation management** — proactive baseline-setting prevents conflict
- **Calibrated honesty** — truth-telling as service, not attack

---

## Usage

When someone presents a request that seems disconnected from reality:

1. Don't argue or moralize
2. Present the baseline ("Here's what's typical...")
3. Show the gap explicitly
4. Let them update their model

**Example response**:
> "I understand you want X at price Y. In my experience, X typically costs Z. Here's why: [evidence]. Given your budget, here are your realistic options: A, B, or C. Which works best for you?"
