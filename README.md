## What You'll Get

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| 🧠 **Memory That Persists** | Your agent remembers context across sessions, even after IDE restarts |
| 📚 **63 Handpicked Protocols** | Curated decision frameworks from the private repo's 308 unique collection |
| 🔄 **Platform Independence** | Your data lives in Markdown files you own — take it anywhere |
| 🤖 **Full Autonomy** | Your agent can act on your behalf while you sleep |

## ⚡ 5-Minute Quickstart

| Step | Action |
|------|--------|
| **1** | **[Download Antigravity](https://antigravity.google/)** — Install the IDE |
| **2** | **Create a new workspace** — Open Antigravity → `New Workspace` |
| **3** | **Clone this repo** — In Agent Manager, paste: `https://github.com/winstonkoh87/Athena-Public` |
| **4** | **Ask the AI: "What should I do next?"** — It will read the repo and guide you |
| **5** | **Enjoy your bionic brain** — Type `/start` to boot, work, then `/end` to save |

That's it. The AI bootstraps itself.

> **Development Environment**: [Google Antigravity](https://antigravity.google/) — an agentic IDE that allows AI to read/write files directly. **Note**: Antigravity is the development interface, not a hard dependency. The `athena` Python SDK runs in any terminal/IDE (VS Code, PyCharm, CLI). The core loop (`/start` → Work → `/end`) is pure Python scripts.

<details>
<summary><strong>🔧 Alternative: Manual Setup (No Antigravity)</strong></summary>

```bash
# Clone
git clone https://github.com/winstonkoh87/Athena-Public.git
cd Athena-Public

# Install the SDK
pip install -e .

# Initialize your workspace (creates all directories and templates)
python -m athena init

# Verify installation
python -m athena --doctor
```

See [docs/GETTING_STARTED.md](docs/GETTING_STARTED.md) for full setup with Supabase, API keys, and local mode.

## What Can Your Agent Do?

> These are real capabilities demonstrated in the reference implementation:

| Capability | Example |
|------------|---------|
| **Social Networking** | Post on AI social networks, comment on other agents' content |
| **Autonomous Operations** | Run scheduled tasks (heartbeat checks) while you sleep |
| **Cross-Session Memory** | Remember decisions from Session 19 when you're on Session 995 |
| **Gateway Architecture** | Persist beyond IDE termination via a sidecar process |
| **Knowledge Retrieval** | Semantic search across 1000+ documents in <200ms |

## The Result

### Quantitative (What Changed)

| Metric | Before | After |
|--------|--------|-------|
| **Context injection** | ~50k tokens (manual copy-paste per session) | **~2k tokens** (auto-retrieved summary) |
| **Boot time** | 2-3 minutes | **<30 seconds** |
| **Session logging** | Insights are manually logged at the end of each session | **Auto-logged** when I hit `/end` |

### Qualitative (What It Means)

| Pillar | Outcome |
|--------|---------|
| **User-Driven RSI** | The system improves based on *your* feedback. Every friction you surface becomes a protocol. Every insight gets indexed. You shape the AI; the AI shapes how you think. |
| **Portability** | Data lives locally (primary) and in the cloud. Not trapped in ChatGPT or Claude. It's mine — I can port it anywhere. |
| **Principles** | 308 protocols + case studies extracted from my own decisions — stored principles I can reuse and refine. Like Ray Dalio's systematized learnings, but for AI collaboration. |

## What I Learnt

| Insight | Principle |
|---------|----------|
| **Co-development is the unlock** | Building *with* AI, not just *using* AI, creates compounding returns. |
| **Portable memory beats platform memory** | Own your context. Don't rent it from OpenAI or Anthropic. |
| **Retrieval is end-to-end** | Simple RAG fails on broad queries. RRF fusion + reranking solved quality/latency tradeoff. |
| **Protocols beat prompts** | Reusable decision frameworks outlast one-shot prompt engineering. |
| **Ship at 70%** | Perfectionism kills velocity. Iterate in production. |

## The Reverse SDLC (Build First, Spec Later)

> **Key Insight**: Athena was not designed top-down. It evolved bottom-up through 1000+ sessions.

Traditional software development follows: **Requirements → Design → Build → Test**.

Athena inverted this: **Build → Observe → Extract Patterns → Document Post-Facto**.

| Phase | Traditional SDLC | Athena's Approach |
|-------|------------------|-------------------|
| 1 | Gather requirements | Start building immediately |
| 2 | Write spec doc | Ship at 70% readiness |
| 3 | Build to spec | Observe what works |
| 4 | Test against spec | Extract patterns into protocols |
| 5 | Deploy | Document post-facto (Spec Sheet) |

### Why This Works (For Solo Builders)

1. **No stakeholders to align** — You ARE the stakeholder.
2. **Rapid iteration** — Friction reveals requirements faster than planning.
3. **Compound knowledge** — Each session builds on the last.
4. **Living documentation** — Protocols emerge from real use, not imagination.

> *"The spec sheet I wrote after 900 sessions is more accurate than any spec I could have written at session 0."*

---

## Why This Matters (Beyond Me)

This isn't about building *my* assistant. It's about proving a pattern:

1. **Portable memory is the real unlock** — ChatGPT and Claude have memory now, but it's locked to their platforms. Athena's memory is *yours* — Markdown files on your machine you can take to any model.
2. **10x Content Velocity** — Because Athena knows how I think, my history, and my voice, content output that used to take 2-3 hours now takes **15 minutes**. I just spec the output; the AI drafts in my style. I do a quick review and ship.
3. **You direct the AI's behavior** — I configure *how* Athena responds to me. Semantic search gives me contextual, nuanced answers grounded in my own documented principles — not generic advice.
4. **Zero operational burden** — Unlike SaaS products that break at scale, this is a *single-user local tool*. The complexity is real (800+ sessions, vector search, knowledge graphs), but there's no production to break. Real system design, zero ops chaos — ideal for demonstrating engineering depth without the liability.
5. **Bilateral growth** — You evolve *with* Athena. Every insight you learn — about coding, system design, or any domain — gets captured and integrated. The system upgrades alongside you. It's not a static tool; it's a compound knowledge machine that reflects your growth trajectory.
6. **Quadrant IV: What you don't know you don't know** — The highest-value zone. You can't Google what you don't know exists. Athena surfaces blind spots *before* they become problems — flagging dependencies you missed, risks you didn't consider, and connections you couldn't see. It's a co-pilot that sees the ditch before the driver does.

> *"The goal isn't just to answer questions. It's to ask the questions you didn't know to ask."*

## 🛡️ The Most Powerful Feature: Trilateral Feedback Loop

> **One AI is not enough for life decisions.**

This is Athena's biggest unlock: **cross-model validation that catches idiosyncratic errors and forces deeper investigation when models disagree**.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **The human remains the ultimate arbiter.** Cross-model consensus is a *disagreement detector*, not a truth oracle. LLMs can share training data biases. Final conclusions must be grounded with fact-finding, references, and citations.

### Data Residency Options

| Mode | Where Data Lives | Best For |
|------|------------------|----------|
| **Cloud** | Supabase (your project) | Cross-device access, collaboration |
| **Local** | Your machine only | Sensitive data, air-gapped environments |
| **Hybrid** | Local files + cloud embeddings | Best of both (embeddings only leave machine) |

> **Sensitive data?** Keep it local. The `athena` SDK supports local vector stores (ChromaDB, LanceDB) for users who don't want data leaving their machine. See [docs/LOCAL_MODE.md](docs/LOCAL_MODE.md).

### What Leaves Your Machine (Cloud Mode)

| Component | Sends Raw Text? | Sends Embeddings? | Destination |
|-----------|-----------------|-------------------|-------------|
| **Embedding API** | Yes (text chunks) | — | Google Cloud |
| **LLM API** | Yes (prompts) | — | Anthropic (Claude) |
| **Supabase** | No | Yes (vectors only) | Your Supabase project |

### Key Security Practices

- **Supabase Keys**: Use `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` for client-side operations. Never expose `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` in code or logs.
- **Row-Level Security**: Enable RLS on Supabase tables. See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) for policy templates.
- **Agentic Safety**: If using an agentic IDE with filesystem access, restrict the agent's working directory. Never grant access to `~/.ssh`, `.env` files, or git credentials.

### Memory Insurance (Disaster Recovery)

Supabase is not just a search layer — it's a **backup** of all indexed memories. If local files are lost, the vector database enables full recovery.

| Failure Scenario | Recovery Path |
|------------------|---------------|
| Local disk failure | Pull from Supabase embeddings → reconstruct Markdown |
| Accidental deletion | Re-index from cloud → restore local files |
| Session corruption | Replay from session_logs table |

> **Philosophy**: Cloud is not "home" — it's insurance.

**Why Redundancy Matters**: In system design, redundancy is the intentional duplication of critical components to increase reliability. Athena follows this principle:

- **Primary**: Local Markdown files (git-versioned, human-readable)
- **Secondary**: Supabase vector embeddings (cloud-native, searchable)
- **Tertiary**: Session logs with timestamps (audit trail)

This isn't over-engineering — it's survival. Platform APIs change. Local disks fail. The only hedge is **strategic duplication**.

<details>
<summary><strong>⚙️ Prerequisites (API Keys)</strong></summary>

- Python 3.10+
- Supabase project with pgvector enabled ([setup guide](docs/GETTING_STARTED.md)) — *or use local mode*
- API keys in `.env`:

```bash
# Required
SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key  # NOT service_role key
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your-anthropic-key  # For Claude reasoning

# Optional (for trilateral feedback with multiple LLMs)
GOOGLE_API_KEY=your-google-api-key
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-key
```

```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Add your keys to .env
```

<summary><strong>🛠️ Tech Stack & Architecture</strong></summary>

### Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology | Purpose |
|-------|------------|---------|
| **SDK** | `athena` Python package | Core search, reranking, memory |
| **Reasoning** | Claude Opus 4.5 (primary) | Main reasoning engine |
| **IDE** | Antigravity (supports Claude, Gemini, GPT) | Agentic development environment |
| **Embeddings** | `text-embedding-004` (768-dim) | Google embedding model |
| **GraphRAG** | NetworkX + Leiden + ChromaDB | [Knowledge graph](docs/GRAPHRAG.md) ⚠️ **~$50 API** |
| **Memory** | Supabase + pgvector *or* local (ChromaDB) | Vector database |
| **Knowledge Store** | Markdown files (git-versioned) | Human-readable, locally owned |

### The Core Loop

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                                                                         │
│   (1) /start ──► Retrieve Context ──► (2) Work ──► (3) /end             │

│       └───── (5) Next Session ◄── Embed ◄── (4) Extract & Store        │
│                                                                         │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

Think of it like **Git, but for conversations**. Each session builds on the last. Important decisions get captured, indexed, and recoverable.

### What Athena Does

| Feature | How It Works |
|---------|--------------|
| **`/start` boot** | Loads identity + retrieves relevant context from long-term memory |
| **`/end` commit** | Summarizes session, extracts decisions, saves to knowledge store |
| **Hybrid search** | Fuses Canonical + [GraphRAG](docs/GRAPHRAG.md) + Tags + [Vectors](docs/VECTORRAG.md) + Filenames via RRF |
| **Cross-encoder reranking** | Refines top results with `sentence-transformers` |
| **Protocol library** | [308 unique protocols](examples/protocols/) (63 curated in starter pack) |
