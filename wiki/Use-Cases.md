# 🎯 Use Cases

Athena is domain-agnostic — it adapts to whatever *you* do. Most users converge on six core workflows.

## 🎯 Decision-Making

> *"Should I take this job offer? Should I pivot my business? Should I invest in this asset?"*

Athena's [Trilateral Feedback Protocol](https://github.com/winstonkoh87/Athena-Public/blob/main/docs/TRILATERAL_FEEDBACK.md) runs your decision through **3 independent AI models**, cross-validates their reasoning, and synthesizes a weighted recommendation — based on Ray Dalio's Believability-Weighted Decision Making.

Under the hood, Athena uses **MCDA (Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis)** and **pairwise comparison** — calibrated to *your* history, *your* revealed preferences, and *your* risk profile built over hundreds of sessions. The result isn't generic advice; it's a well-calibrated recommendation tuned to how **you** actually make decisions.

## 🧩 Problem-Solving

> *"Why is my conversion rate dropping? Why does this architecture keep breaking? What am I missing?"*

Graph of Thoughts reasoning generates **multiple solution paths**, scores each on survivability and upside, then converges on the strongest answer — not just the first one. Combined with First Principles Deconstruction, Athena breaks complex problems into their atomic components and rebuilds from there.

Athena can **map out multiple scenarios and timelines within minutes** — running sensitivity analysis across key variables to show you not just the best-case answer, but the full decision surface.

## 🔬 Research & Synthesis

> *"Give me a comprehensive analysis of X. Synthesize these 12 sources. Find the consensus and the outliers."*

The Cyborg Methodology enforces sentence-level human-AI collaboration — not "delegate and pray." Athena runs structured research across multiple sources, cross-validates findings, and produces cited output with confidence levels.

The speed differential is the real force multiplier: Athena's exo-cortex can fire **hundreds of queries across your local knowledge base in milliseconds** — cross-referencing session logs, case studies, protocols, and external sources simultaneously.

## 📚 Personal Knowledge Management

> *"What did I decide about X three months ago? What were my reasons? What happened after?"*

This is the **core product.** Every session auto-saves into structured memory: session logs, case studies, user profiles, decision history. Over hundreds of sessions, Athena builds a searchable archive of *your* thinking — not generic knowledge, but **your** frameworks, **your** blind spots, **your** patterns.

Because your memory lives as **portable Markdown files**, Athena is inherently **platform-agnostic and model-agnostic**. Switch from Claude to Gemini tomorrow — your memory comes with you. **Your knowledge is never held hostage.**

## 📐 Strategic Planning

> *"Map out my next 6 months. Stress-test this business model. Show me the unit economics."*

Long-horizon planning with **longitudinal memory** — Athena doesn't just plan, it tracks decisions and their outcomes across sessions.

For quantitative planning, Athena can run **Monte Carlo simulations** (10,000+ rounds) with the right data inputs — so you don't just see the *expected* outcome, you see the **full probability distribution** of outcomes. Both the **ensemble average** (what happens across all possible futures) and the **time average** (what happens to *you* walking one specific path).

## 🧠 Meta-Thinking (Quadrant IV)

> *"What am I not seeing? What question should I be asking that I'm not?"*

This is the capability most people don't know they need — because by definition, **you can't identify your own blind spots**. That's the Quadrant IV problem: unknown unknowns.

Athena solves this by combining longitudinal pattern detection (hundreds of sessions of *your* behavior) with the Trilateral Feedback Protocol's multi-model cross-validation. When three independent models converge on a concern you haven't raised, that signal has weight. This isn't generic "have you considered..." prompting — it's **calibrated meta-cognition** built from your actual decision history.
