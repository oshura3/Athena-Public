# Getting Help

> **Before opening an issue, ask Athena first.** That's what it's built for.

## Step 1: Ask Athena

Most questions can be answered by your own Athena agent. Try asking it directly:

- *"How do I get a Gemini API key?"*
- *"How do I write a protocol?"*
- *"What is the memory bank?"*
- *"How do I set up Supabase?"*

Athena has access to all documentation, architecture files, and protocols. If it can't answer, it will tell you.

## Step 2: Search Existing Issues

Before opening a new issue, [search existing issues](https://github.com/winstonkoh87/Athena-Public/issues) to see if someone has already asked.

## Step 3: Open an Issue

If Athena couldn't help and no existing issue covers your problem:

| Type | Template | What to include |

| Question | [Question](https://github.com/winstonkoh87/Athena-Public/issues/new?template=question.md) | What you asked Athena, and why the answer was insufficient |
